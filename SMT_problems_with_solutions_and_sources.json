We have $ 2\\sin^2(\\theta)+\\sin(\\theta)-1=0 $, and so $ \\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{2} $ or $ -1 $. We can immediately discard $ -1 $, and so $ \\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{2} $. Since $ \\theta $ is clearly less than $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} $, we see that $ \\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} $. Thus, the area of the trapezoid is $ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}} $.",

However, if we put $ n $ as either 5 or 6, $ 7^1 $ will divide the combination because the factorial of  $ n $ will not contain 7 and the factor of $ 2006 - n $ will contain one less 7. However, this would be the same if  $ n $ was raised by any integer multiples of 7. We can use similar logic to also find when the second and third parts of the floor functions will increase by 1, using that the largest multiples of 49 and 343 that are under 2006 are 1960 and 1715 respectively. Therefore, each of the 3 cases will increase the highest power of 7 by one. \\[ n = 7k + \\{5,6\\} \\] \\[ n = 49i + \\{47,48\\} \\] \\[ n = 343j + \\{291,292, \\ldots, 343\\} \\] Obviously, each of these 3 cases would have to be fulfilled.

If $a$ is even in this case, then $b$ must be even and if $a$ is odd in this case then $b$ must be odd and we have that numbers of the same parity when added or subtracted to each other. So that means if $a^2 - b^2$ is even, it must be a multiple of $4$.\n\n\n\nIt's easy to prove that all odd numbers can be represented. Call the odd number you want represented as the difference of $2$ squares $2x - 1$ where $x$ is an integer. If $a-b=1$ and $a+b = 2x-1$, then we have that $2a = 2x, a=x, b=x-1$ so both are integers and can express any odd number $2x - 1$ as all odd numbers can be expressed as $2x - 1$\n\n\n\nIn the same fashion, we can prove that all multiples of $4$ can be obtained. Call a multiple of $4, 4x$ where x is an integer. Then we have that $a+b = 2x, a-b = 2 \\rightarrow 2a = 2x + 2 \\rightarrow a = x+1 \\rightarrow b = x-1$. Since $4x$ represents all multiples of $4$ we have now shown that each multiple of $4$ can be represented as $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$\n\n\n\n(wait was what I just did really necessary?)\n\n\n\nAnyways, the only numbers that cannot be shown are multiples of $2$ that aren't multiples of $4$.\n\n\n\nThe first positive number that can't be shown is $2$, and then $6$, and then $10$ and then $4x - 2$ where $x$ is the $xth$ number that can't be shown.\n\n\n\nSo when $x=2000 \\rightarrow 4(2000) - 2 = 7998$ So the 2000th positive integer that can't be shown is $\\boxed{7998}$",

        "solution": "Y by Adventure10complementary countingFirst of all, note 1990 AIME problem 9\n\n\n\nAnyways, this is how I did that problem.\n\n\n\nFirst off, if there are All $1s$, then there can be no consecutive $0s$. That's $1$ way.\n\n\n\nIf there's $1$ $0$, then there are still no ways for there to be consecutive  $0s$. That's $\\dbinom{10}{1} = 10$ ways.\n\n\n\nIf there are $2$ $0s$ then there are $\\dbinom{10}{2}$ ways to arrange all then numbers (choose $2$ spots to where you can place the $0s$) and then $9$ ways such that the $0$s are next to each other (from $0$ $1s$ in front of them to $8$ $1s$ in front of them). $45 - 9 = 36$ ways in this case.\n\n\n\nWith $3$ $0s$, this problem gets way uglier. We can't do what we did before, that would take way too much time to count. Instead we know that the $0s$ must be separated like so $01010$\n\n\n\nThere are now $5$ $1s$ left. In this case we can use balls and urns. We know that the number of $1s$ before the first $0$ added to the number of $1s$ in between the first $2$ $0s$ plus the number of $1s$ between the last $2$ $0s$ plus the number of ones after the last $0$ has to add up to $5$ (not counting the $1s$ already put in place.)\n\n\n\nSo there are $5$ \"balls\" and $4$ \"urns\". Since some of these \"urns\" may contain $0$ $1s$, we have that the number of ways to have no consecutive $0s$ is $\\dbinom{8}{3} = 56$\n\n\n\nNow we do the same for $4$ $0s \\rightarrow 0101010$ Now there are 3 $1s$ or \"balls\" left and $5$ \"urns\" (before the first $0$, in between $0s$, then after the last $0$). We obtain the binomial $\\dbinom{7}{4} = 35$\n\n\n\nFinally, we have the case where there are $5$ $0s$ Using the same technique (although not necessary) We have the sequence $010101010$ Now we have $6$ total places to place the final $1$ (again before the first $0$, in between 2 consecutive $0$s and after the last $0$.)\n\n\n\nSo the total is $1+10+36+56+35+6 = 144$ ways to not have consecutive $0s$ (note that if there are more than $5 0s$ there must be at least one pair of consecutive $0s$)\n\n\n\nSo the total probability is $\\frac{1024-144}{1024} = 1 - \\frac{9}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{55}{64}}$\n\n\n\nEDIT:woo 300th post\n\n\n\nEDIT: Lol had to edit this post 3 times because it was my 300th post",

        "solution": "Y by Adventure10, Mango247There's probably a better way of doing this...Firstly, there are $ 6 $ ways of choosing which number is in its correct place. Then, we want to count the number of ways to rearrange the remaining $ 5 $ numbers such that none of them are in their correct place.\n\n\n\nDenote $ a_n $ as the number of ways to arrange $ n $ numbers such that none of the numbers are in their correct place. We want to find $ 6a_5 $. Using complimenatry counting, $ a_5 $ is $ 5!=120 $ minus the number of ways to arrange five numbers such that exactly one is in its right place, exactly two are in their right place, and so on.\n\n\n\nWe use similar reasoning for each of these. The number of ways to arrange five numbers such that exactly one is in its right place is $ \\binom{5}{1}a_4=5a_4 $, exactly two in their right place is $ \\binom{5}{2}a_3=10a_3 $, exactly three in their right place is $ \\binom{5}{3}a_2=10a_2 $, exactly four in their right place is $ \\binom{5}{4}a_1=5a_1 $, and exactly five in their right place is simply $ 1 $ (to avoid going into 'the number of ways to arrange zero numbers'). Therefore, we have $ a_5=120-(5a_4+10a_3+10a_2+5a_1+1) $.\n\n\n\nNow we need to determine $ a_1, a_2, a_3, $ and $ a_4 $. To determine $ a_4 $, you could repeat this process again (which I find tedious enough already), or, since there are only $ 24 $ such arrangements, it may be easier simply to list them out. We thus find that $ a_4=9 $. $ a_1, a_2, $ and  $ a_3 $ are easily counted to be $ 0, 1, $ and $ 2 $, respectively.\n\n\n\nTherefore, $ a_5=120-(5\\cdot9+10\\cdot2+10\\cdot1+5\\cdot0+1)=44 $, and $ 6a_5=\\boxed{264} $.",

Since this year is a leap year, there are $ 29 $ days this month, and so $ 3 $ days until the end of this month. Then, using '30 days hath September, April, June, and November', there are $ 31 $ days in March, and then an additional $ 24 $ days, for a total of $ 58 $ days to get to April 24, 2012.\n\n\n\n1977 is $ 35 $ years before 2012, and each year has $ 365 $ days (except for leap years, but we'll get to that). Therefore, April 24, 1977 was $ 35\\cdot365-58+1 $ days ago, not counting leap years. The reason we add $ 1 $ is that we don't count today in the $ 58 $, and we do count it in the $ 35\\cdot365 $, but we don't want to count today, so we have to add $ 1 $ to the number of days ago it was. As for leap years, every year that's a multiple of $ 4 $ and not a multiple of $ 100 $, or is a multiple of $ 400 $ is a leap year. Therefore, $ 1980, 1984,\\cdots2008 $ were leap years (we've already accounted for the leap year this year). This makes a total of $ 8 $ extra days, and so April 24, 1977 was $ 35\\cdot365-58+1+8=35\\cdot365-49 $ days ago.\n\n\n\n$ 35\\cdot365 $ is a multiple of $ 7 $, so we don't need to worry about that when counting days of the week.

In fact, because $PM=\\sqrt{PF\\cdot PX}=18$, the homothety has ratio $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ since $MT=18$, i.e., the corresponding parts of $O_1$ and $O_2$ are in ratio $2:1$.

Changing the bounds of integration according to $u=ln(x)$, the integral becomes $\\int_{e_{3}}^{e_{5}} \\frac{e^{u}}{e^{u}u(ln(u))(ln(ln(u)))}du =\\int_{e_{3}}^{e_{5}} \\frac{1}{u(ln(u))(ln(ln(u)))} du$.

I have this much:\n\nSuppose $n$ has more than $1$ prime factor. Let its smallest prime factors then be $a$ and $b$ with $a<b$. It must be the case that $a_2=a$ and $a_3=b$. Then $-a^3\\equiv b^3-a^3\\equiv a_3^3-a_2^3\\equiv n\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}\\implies a\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$, which contradicts $a$ being prime and distinct from $b$. Thus, $n$ has only $1$ prime factor. Let $p$ be this prime factor and let $e$ be such that $p^e=n$. We have $p^3(p^3-1)=(p^2)^3-p^3=a_3^3-a_2^3=n=p^e$.\n\nThis means that $p^3-1$ is a power of $p$, which is impossible.\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n$a_2$ must be the smallest prime factor of $n$. Suppose $a_3$ is a prime number. Then $-a_2^3\\equiv {a_3}^3-{a_2}^3\\equiv n\\equiv 0\\pmod{a_3}\\implies a_2\\equiv 0\\pmod{a_3}$, which contradicts $a_2$ being prime and distinct from $a_3$. Then it must be the case that $a_3=a_2^2$. We have $n=a_3^3-a_2^3=(a_2^2)^3-a_2^3=a_2^3(a_2^3-1)=a_2^3(a_2-1)(a_2^2+a_2+1)$. If $a_2>2$, then $a_2-1>1$ and has a prime factor. This prime factor must be less than $a_2$. But it is also a factor of $n$, which contradicts $a_2$ being the smallest prime factor of $n$. Thus, $a_2-1=1\\implies a_2=2$ and $n=a_3^3-a_2^3=(2^2)^3-2^3=64-8=56$.\n\nS6Consider the circumcircle of this polygon. By the Inscribed Right Angle Theorem, a chosen triangle being a right triangle is equivalent to having one of its sides as a diameter of the circumcircle. There are $\\binom{2018}{3}$ ways to choose a triangle, and $1009$ diameters and thus $1009\\cdot 2016$ ways to choose a right triangle. The probability of choosing a right triangle is $\\frac{1009\\cdot 2016}{\\binom{2018}{3}}=(1009\\cdot 2016)\\div \\frac{2018\\cdot 2017\\cdot 2016}{3!}=\\frac{1009\\cdot 2016\\cdot 6}{2018\\cdot 2017\\cdot 2016}=\\frac{3}{2017}$.\n\nS11Old solution:\n\nLet $S$ denote the set of positive integers.

Let $ABCD$ be a unit square. The point $E$ lies on $BC$ and $F$ lies on$ AD$. $\\vartriangle AEF$ is equilateral. $GHIJ$ is a square inscribed in $\\vartriangle AEF$ so that $\\overline{GH}$ is on $\\overline{EF}$. Compute the area of $GHIJ$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2. Find all integers $x$ for which $|x^3 + 6x^2 + 2x - 6|$ is prime.\n\n\n\n\n\np3. Let $A$ be the set of points $(a, b)$ with $2 < a < 6$, $-2 < b < 2$ such that the equation $$ax^4 + 2x^3 - 2(2b - a)x^2 + 2x + a = 0$$has at least one real root.

Let $\\vartriangle ABC$ be equilateral. Two points $D$ and $E$ are on side $BC$ (with order $B, D, E, C$), and satisfy $\\angle DAE = 30^o$. If $BD = 2$ and $CE = 3$, what is $BC$?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np6. Three numbers are chosen at random between $0$ and $2$. What is the probability that the difference between the greatest and least is less than $1/4$?\n\n\n\n\n\np7. Tony the mouse starts in the top left corner of a $ 3\\times 3$ grid. After each second, he randomly moves to an adjacent square with equal probability. What is the probability he reaches the cheese in the bottom right corner before he reaches the mousetrap in the center?\n\n\n\n\n\np8. Let $A = (0, 0)$, $B = (1, 0)$, and $C = (0, 1)$. Divide $AB$ into $n$ equal segments, and call the endpoints of these segments $A = B_0, B_1, B_2, ..., B_n = B$. Similarly, divide $AC$ into $n$ equal segments with endpoints $A = C_0, C_1, C_2, ... , C_n = C$. By connecting $B_i$ and $C_{n-i}$ for all $0 \\le i \\le n$, one gets a piecewise curve consisting of the uppermost line segments. Find the equation of the limit of this piecewise curve as $n$ goes to infinity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np9. Determine the maximum number of distinct regions into which $2011$ circles of arbitrary size can partition the plane.\n\n\n\n\n\np10. For positive reals $x, y$, and $z$, compute the maximum possible value of $\\frac{xyz(x + y + z)}{(x + y)^2(y + z)^2}$.\n\n\n\n\n\np11. Find the diameter of an icosahedron with side length $ 1$ (an icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with $20$ identical equilateral triangle faces, a picture is given below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np12. Find the boundary of the projection of the sphere $x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 1$ onto the plane $z = 0$ with respect to the point $P = (0, -1, 2)$. Express your answer in the form $f(x, y) = 0$, where $f(x, y)$ is a function of $x$ and $y$.\n\n\n\n\n\np13. Compute the number of pairs of $2011$-tuples $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_{2011})$ and $(y_1, y_2, ..., y_{2011})$ such that $x_k =x^2_{k-1} - y^2_{k-1} - 2$ and $y_k = 2x_{k-1}y_{k-1}$ for $1 \\le k \\le 2010$, $x_1 = x^2_{2011} - y^2_{2011} - 2$, and $y_1 = 2x_{2011}y_{2011}$.\n\n\n\n\n\np14.
