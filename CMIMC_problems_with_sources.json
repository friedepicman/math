To make the game as interesting as possible, Mellon Game Lab would like the grid to be as large as possible and for no $2\\times 2$ grid to appear more than once in the big grid. The grid above doesn't work, as the following $2\\times 2$ grid appears twice, once in the top left corner (rotated $90^\\circ$ counterclockwise) and once directly below it (overlapping). \n \n [asy]\nsize(2cm);\ndefaultpen(fontsize(16pt));\nstring b = \"\";\nstring u = \"$\\uparrow$\";\nstring d = \"$\\downarrow$\";\nstring l = \"$\\leftarrow$\";\nstring r = \"$\\rightarrow$\";\n// input should be n x n\nstring[][] input =\n{{b,r},{d,b}};\nint n = input.length;\n// draw table\nfor (int i=0; i<=n; ++i)\n{\n draw((i,0)--(i,n));\n draw((0,i)--(n,i));\n}\n// fill table\nfor (int i=1; i<=n; ++i)\n{\n for (int j=1; j<=n; ++j)\n {\n  label(input[i-1][j-1], (j-0.5,n-i+0.5));\n }\n}\n[/asy] \n \n Let's call a grid that avoids such repeats a repeat-free grid . We are interested in finding out for which $n$ constructing an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid is possible. Here's what we know so far. Any $2\\times 2$ grid is repeat-free, as there is only one subgrid to worry about, and there can't possibly be any repeats. If we can construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid, we can also construct a $k\\times k$ repeat-free grid for any $k\\leq n$ by just taking the top left $k\\times k$ of the original one we found. By the previous observation, if it is impossible to construct such an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid, we cannot construct a $k\\times k$ repeat-free grid for any $k\\geq n$ , as otherwise we could take the top left $n\\times n$ to get one working for $n$ . \n These three observations together tell us that either we can construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid for all $n\\geq 2$ , or there exists some upper limit $N\\geq 2$ such that we can construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid for all $n\\leq N$ but cannot construct one for any $n> N$ . Your goal is to determine if such an $N$ exists, and if so, place bounds on its value. \n \n More precisely, this problem consists of two parts: a lower bound and an upper bound. For the lower bound, to show that $N\\geq n$ for some $n$ , you need to construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid (you do not need to prove your construction works). For the upper bound, to show that $N$ is at most some value $n$ , you must prove that it is impossible to construct an $(n+1)\\times (n+1)$ repeat-free grid. \n \n Proposed by Connor Gordon and Eric Oh",
