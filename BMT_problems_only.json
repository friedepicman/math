    "text": "A baseball league has $64$ people, each with a different $6$-digit binary number whose base-$10$ value ranges from $0$ to $63$. When any player bats, they do the following: for each pitch, they swing if their corresponding bit number is a $1$, otherwise, they decide to wait and let the ball pass. For example, the player with the number $11$ has binary number $001011$. For the first and second pitch, they wait; for the third, they swing, and so on. Pitchers follow a similar rule to decide whether to throw a splitter or a fastball, if the bit is $0$, they will throw a splitter, and if the bit is $1$, they will throw a fastball. If a batter swings at a fastball, then they will score a hit; if they swing on a splitter, they will miss and get a “strike.” If a batter waits on a fastball, then they will also get a strike. If a batter waits on a splitter, then they get a “ball.” If a batter gets $3$ strikes, then they are out; if a batter gets $4$ balls, then they automatically get a hit. For example, if player $11$ pitched against player $6$ (binary is $000110$), the batter would get a ball for the first pitch, a ball for the second pitch, a strike for the third pitch, a strike for the fourth pitch, and a hit for the fifth pitch; as a result, they will count that as a “hit.” If player $11$ pitched against player $5$ (binary is $000101$), however, then the fifth pitch would be the batter’s third strike, so the batter would be “out.” Each player in the league plays against every other player exactly twice; once as batter, and once as pitcher. They are then given a score equal to the number of outs they throw as a pitcher plus the number of hits they get as a batter. What is the highest score received?",

Call a $k$-inversion $(0 < k\\le n)$ of a sequence to be indices $i_1, i_2,.., i_k$ such that $i_1 < i_2 <.. < i_k$ but $a_{i1} > a_{i2} >...> a_{ik}$. Calculate the expected number of $6$-inversions in a random permutation of the set $\\{1, 2,..., 10\\}$. p6. Chell is given a strip of squares labeled $1,.., 6$ all placed side to side. For each $k \\in {1,..., 6}$, she then chooses one square at random in $\\{1,..., k\\}$ and places a Weighted Storage Cube there. After she has placed all $6$ cubes, she computes her score as follows: For each square, she takes the number of cubes in the pile and then takes the square (i.e. if there were 3 cubes in a square, her score for that square would be $9$). Her overall score is the sum of the scores of each square. What is the expected value of her score? PS. You had better use hide for answers.",

If $n > 2$, she can either choose to let the value rolled be her score, or she can choose to roll a $n - 1$ sided fair die, continuing the process. What is the expected value of her score assuming Katniss starts with a $6$ sided die and plays to maximize this expected value? p3. Suppose that $f(x) = x^6 + ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f$, and that $f(1) = f(2) = f(3) = f(4) = f(5) = f(6) = 7$. What is $a$? p4. $a$ and $b$ are positive integers so that $20a+12b$ and $20b-12a$ are both powers of $2$, but $a+b$ is not. Find the minimum possible value of $a + b$. p5. Square $ABCD$ and rhombus $CDEF$ share a side. If $m\\angle DCF = 36^o$, find the measure of $\\angle AEC$. p6. Tom challenges Harry to a game. Tom first blindfolds Harry and begins to set up the game. Tom places $4$ quarters on an index card, one on each corner of the card. It is Harry’s job to flip all the coins either face-up or face-down using the following rules: (a) Harry is allowed to flip as many coins as he wants during his turn. (b) A turn consists of Harry flipping as many coins as he wants (while blindfolded). When he is happy with what he has flipped, Harry will ask Tom whether or not he was successful in flipping all the coins face-up or face-down. If yes, then Harry wins. If no, then Tom will take the index card back, rotate the card however he wants, and return it back to Harry, thus starting Harry’s next turn. Note that Tom cannot touch the coins after he initially places them before starting the game. Assuming that Tom’s initial configuration of the coins weren’t all face-up or face-down, and assuming that Harry uses the most efficient algorithm, how many moves maximum will Harry need in order to win? Or will he never win? PS. You had better use hide for answers.",
