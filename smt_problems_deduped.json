We can place either Silas's or Lekan's in it, since they have not been placed in envelopes. However, we realize that we must put Lekan's letter in that envelope, or else Lekan's letter would go in its correct envelope. Thus, there isway to accomplish that. This argument applies in general, so there areways to place all the letters in incorrect envelopes. There areways to put the letters into the envelopes, so the probability is.

If $a$ is even in this case, then $b$ must be even and if $a$ is odd in this case then $b$ must be odd and we have that numbers of the same parity when added or subtracted to each other.

Then we have that . $a+b = 2x, a-b = 2 \\rightarrow 2a = 2x + 2 \\rightarrow a = x+1 \\rightarrow b = x-1$ Since $4x$ represents all multiples of $4$ we have now shown that each multiple of $4$ can be represented as $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$    (wait was what I just did really necessary?)    Anyways, the only numbers that cannot be shown are multiples of $2$ that aren't multiples of . $4$    The first positive number that can't be shown is , $2$ , and then , $6$ , and then $10$ and then $4x - 2$ where $x$ is the $xth$ number that can't be shown.

I have this much:  Suppose $n$ has more than $1$ prime factor. Let its smallest prime factors then be $a$ and $b$ with . $a<b$ It must be the case that $a_2=a$ and . $a_3=b$ Then , $-a^3\\equiv b^3-a^3\\equiv a_3^3-a_2^3\\equiv n\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}\\implies a\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$ , which contradicts $a$ being prime and distinct from . $b$ Thus, $n$ has only $1$ prime factor. Let $p$ be this prime factor and let $e$ be such that . $p^e=n$ We have . $p^3(p^3-1)=(p^2)^3-p^3=a_3^3-a_2^3=n=p^e$  This means that $p^3-1$ is a power of , $p$ , which is impossible.    Solution:   $a_2$ must be the smallest prime factor of . $n$ Suppose $a_3$ is a prime number. Then , $-a_2^3\\equiv {a_3}^3-{a_2}^3\\equiv n\\equiv 0\\pmod{a_3}\\implies a_2\\equiv 0\\pmod{a_3}$ , which contradicts $a_2$ being prime and distinct from . $a_3$ Then it must be the case that . $a_3=a_2^2$ We have . $n=a_3^3-a_2^3=(a_2^2)^3-a_2^3=a_2^3(a_2^3-1)=a_2^3(a_2-1)(a_2^2+a_2+1)$ If , $a_2>2$ , then $a_2-1>1$ and has a prime factor. This prime factor must be less than . $a_2$ But it is also a factor of , $n$ , which contradicts $a_2$ being the smallest prime factor of . $n$ Thus, $a_2-1=1\\implies a_2=2$ and . $n=a_3^3-a_2^3=(2^2)^3-2^3=64-8=56$   S6 S6 Consider the circumcircle of this polygon.

There are $30$ owls in a row starting from left to right and Sammy (their coach) is facing them. They have a warmup routine involving trading places in rounds. Each round involves three phases. In the first phase of each round, the owls in the odd positions rotate to the right while the owls in even positions do not move. For example, the first owl moves to the third owl’s spot who is moving to the fifth owl’s spot, etc. Note the t $29$ t h owl will wrap around and move to the first owl’s spot. The second phase occurs after the first is completed and in this phase the owls in positions which leave a remainder of 1 when divided by $3$ rotate to the right. All other owls stay fixed. For example, the owl in position $ 1$ would move to position . $4$ In the last phase of each round only owls in positions that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by $ 5$ move. These owls however move left! The next round then begins back at phase . $ 1$ The warmup continues until the owls are back in their original order. How many rounds does this take?       p10. p10.

Suppose a king has $25!$ grains of rice after collecting taxes.

        "solution": "First, Sophie Germain's Identity tells us that $$x^4 + 4 = (x^2-2x+2)(x^2+2x+2).$$  It follows that $$f(4k-1) = (16k^2-16k+5)(16k^2+1),$$ and $$f(4k-3) = (16k^2-32k+17)(16k^2-16k+5),$$ which implies that   \\begin{align*} \\prod_{k=1}^{2021} \\frac{f(4k-1)}{f(4k-3)} &= \\prod_{k=1}^{2021} \\frac{(16k^2-16k+5)(16k^2+1)}{(16k^2-32k+17)(16k^2-16k+5)} \\\\ &= \\prod_{k=1}^{2021} \\frac{16k^2+1}{16k^2-32k+17}. \\end{align*} Now, let $f(k)$ be the polynomial in the numerator and let $g(x)$ be the polynomial in the denominator.    Note that $$g(k+1) = 16k^2+1 = f(k),$$ so the numerator of one fraction in the product cancels with the denominator of the next fraction in the product (except for the numerator of the very last fraction).    Hence, through telescoping, we see that   \\begin{align*} P = \\prod_{k=1}^{2021} \\frac{16k^2+1}{16k^2-32k+17} &= \\prod_{k=1}^{2021} \\frac{f(k)}{g(k)} \\\\ &= \\frac{f(2021}{g(1)} \\\\ &= \\frac{16 \\cdot 2021^2+1}{16\\cdot1^2-32\\cdot1+17} \\\\ &= \\frac{16 \\cdot 2021^2+1}{16-32+17} \\\\ &= \\frac{16 \\cdot 2021^2+1}{1} \\\\ &= 16 \\cdot 2021^2+1 \\\\ &\\equiv 16 \\cdot 21^2 + 1 \\\\ &\\equiv 16 \\cdot 441 + 1 \\\\ &\\equiv 7056 + 1 \\\\ &\\equiv 7057 \\\\ &\\equiv \\boxed{57} \\pmod{1000}. \\end{align*} $\\square$",

The 15 problems p1-15 come from Stanford Math Tournament. Rice Math Tournament had 13 same problems and p16, p17 as substitutes of problems p5 and p11.     p1. p1. Let $ABCD$ be a unit square. The point $E$ lies on $BC$ and $F$ lies o n. n $ AD$  $\\vartriangle AEF$ is equilateral. $GHIJ$ is a square inscribed in $\\vartriangle AEF$ so that $\\overline{GH}$ is on . $\\overline{EF}$ Compute the area of . $GHIJ$          p2. p2. Find all integers $x$ for which $|x^3 + 6x^2 + 2x - 6|$ is prime.       p3. p3. Let $A$ be the set of points $(a, b)$ with , $2 < a < 6$ ,  $-2 < b < 2$ such that the equation  has at least one real root. Determine the area of . $A$       p4. p4. Three nonnegative reals $x, y, z$ satisfy $x + y + z = 12$ and . $xy + yz + zx = 21$ Find the maximum of . $xyz$       p5. p5. Let $\\vartriangle ABC$ be equilateral. Two points $D$ and $E$ are on side $BC$ (with order ) $B, D, E, C$ ) , and satisfy . $\\angle DAE = 30^o$ If $BD = 2$ and , $CE = 3$ , what is ? $BC$ ?          p6. p6. Three numbers are chosen at random between $0$ and . $2$ What is the probability that the difference between the greatest and least is less than ? $1/4$ ?       p7. p7. Tony the mouse starts in the top left corner of a $ 3\\times 3$ grid. After each second, he randomly moves to an adjacent square with equal probability. What is the probability he reaches the cheese in the bottom right corner before he reaches the mousetrap in the center?       p8. p8. Let , $A = (0, 0)$ ,  , $B = (1, 0)$ , and . $C = (0, 1)$ Divide $AB$ into $n$ equal segments, and call the endpoints of these segments . $A = B_0, B_1, B_2, ..., B_n = B$ Similarly, divide $AC$ into $n$ equal segments with endpoints . $A = C_0, C_1, C_2, ... , C_n = C$ By connecting $B_i$ and $C_{n-i}$ for all , $0 \\le i \\le n$ , one gets a piecewise curve consisting of the uppermost line segments. Find the equation of the limit of this piecewise curve as $n$ goes to infinity.          p9. p9.
