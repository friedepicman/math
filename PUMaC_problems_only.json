    "text": "instructionsTime limit: 20 minutes. Fill in the crossword above with answers to the problems below. Notice that there are three directions instead of two. You are probably used to \"down\" and \"across,\" but this crossword has \"1,\" $e^{4\\pi i/3}$, and $e^{5\\pi i/3}$. You can think of these labels as complex numbers pointing in the direction to fill in the spaces. In other words \"1\" means \"across\", $e^{4\\pi i/3}$ means \"down and to the left,\" and $e^{5\\pi i/3}$ means \"down and to the right.\" To fill in the answer to, for example, $12$ across, start at the hexagon labeled $12$, and write the digits, proceeding to the right along the gray line. (Note: $12$ across has space for exactly $5$ digits.) Each hexagon is worth one point, and must be filled by something from the set $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$. Note that $\\pi$ is not in the set, and neither is $i$, nor $\\sqrt2$, nor $\\heartsuit$,etc. None of the answers will begin with a $0$. \"Concatenate $a$ and $b$\" means to write the digits of $a$, followed by the digits of $b$. For example, concatenating $10$ and $3$ gives $103$. (It's not the same as concatenating $3$ and $10$.) Calculators are allowed! THIS SHEET IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR REFERENCE ONLY. DO NOT TURN IN THIS SHEET. TURN IN THE OFFICIAL ANSWER SHEET PROVIDED TO THE TEAM. OTHERWISE YOU WILL GET A SCORE OF ZERO! ZERO! ZERO! AND WHILE SOMETIMES \"!\" MEANS FACTORIAL, IN THIS CASE IT DOES NOT. Good luck, and have fun! Across (1) A 3. (3 digits) Suppose you draw $5$ vertices of a convex pentagon (but not the sides!). Let $N$ be the number of ways you can draw at least $0$ straight line segments between the vertices so that no two line segments intersect in the interior of the pentagon. What is $N - 64$? (Note what the question is asking for! You have been warned!) A 5. (3 digits) Among integers $\\{1, 2,..., 10^{2012}\\}$, let $n$ be the number of numbers for which the sum of the digits is divisible by $5$. What are the first three digits (from the left) of $n$? A 6. (3 digits) Bob is punished by his math teacher and has to write all perfect squares, one after another. His teacher's blackboard has space for exactly $2012$ digits. He can stop when he cannot fit the next perfect square on the board. (At the end, there might be some space left on the board - he does not write only part of the next perfect square.) If $n^2$ is the largest perfect square he writes, what is $n$? A 8. (3 digits) How many positive integers $n$ are there such that $n \\le 2012$, and the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $2012$ is a prime number? A 9. (4 digits) I have a random number machine generator that is very good at generating integers between $1$ and $256$, inclusive, with equal probability. However, right now, I want to produce a random number between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, so I do the following: $\\bullet$ I use my machine to generate a number between $1$ and $256$. Call this $a$. $\\bullet$ I take a and divide it by $n$ to get remainder $r$. If $r \\ne 0$, then I record $r$ as the randomly generated number. If $r = 0$, then I record $n$ instead. Note that this process does not necessarily produce all numbers with equal probability, but that is okay. I apply this process twice to generate two numbers randomly between $1$ and $10$. Let $p$ be the probability that the two numbers are equal. What is $p \\cdot 2^{16}$? A 12. (5 digits) You and your friend play the following dangerous game. You two start off at some point $(x, y)$ on the plane, where $x$ and $y$ are nonnegative integers. When it is player $A$'s turn, A tells his opponent $B$ to move to another point on the plane. Then $A$ waits for a while. If $B$ is not eaten by a tiger, then $A$ moves to that point as well. From a point $(x, y)$ there are three places $A$ can tell $B$ to walk to: leftwards to $(x - 1, y)$, downwards to $(x, y-1)$, and simultaneously downwards and leftwards to $(x-1, y-1)$. However, you cannot move to a point with a negative coordinate. Now, what was this about being eaten by a tiger? There is a tiger at the origin, which will eat the first person that goes there! Needless to say, you lose if you are eaten. Consider all possible starting points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\le x \\le 346$ and $0 \\le y \\le 346$, and $x$ and $y$ are not both zero. Also suppose that you two play strategically, and you go first (i.e., by telling your friend where to go). For how many of the starting points do you win? Down and to the left $e^{4\\pi i/3}$ DL 2. (2 digits) ABCDE is a pentagon with $AB = BC = CD = \\sqrt2$, $\\angle ABC = \\angle BCD = 120$ degrees, and $\\angle BAE = \\angle CDE = 105$ degrees. Find the area of triangle $\\vartriangle BDE$. Your answer in its simplest form can be written as $\\frac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where where $a, b, c$ are integers and $b$ is square-free. Find $abc$. DL 3. (3 digits) Suppose $x$ and $y$ are integers which satisfy $$\\frac{4x^2}{y^2} + \\frac{25y^2}{x^2} = \\frac{10055}{x^2} +\\frac{4022}{y^2} +\\frac{2012}{x^2y^2}- 20. $$What is the maximum possible value of $xy -1$? DL 5. (3 digits) Find the area of the set of all points in the plane such that there exists a square centered around the point and having the following properties: $\\bullet$ The square has side length $7\\sqrt2$. $\\bullet$ The boundary of the square intersects the graph of $xy = 0$ at at least $3$ points. DL 8. (3 digits) Princeton Tiger has a mom that likes yelling out math problems. One day, the following exchange between Princeton and his mom occurred: $\\bullet$ Mom: Tell me the number of zeros at the end of $2012!$ $\\bullet$ PT: Huh? $2012$ ends in $2$, so there aren't any zeros. $\\bullet$ Mom: No, the exclamation point at the end was not to signify me yelling. I was not asking about $2012$, I was asking about $2012!$. What is the correct answer? DL 9. (4 digits) Define the following: $\\bullet$ $A = \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1}\\frac{1}{n^6}$ $\\bullet$ $B = \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1}\\frac{1}{n^6+1}$ $\\bullet$ $C = \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1}\\frac{1}{(n+1)^6}$ $\\bullet$ $D = \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1}\\frac{1}{(2n-1)^6}$ $\\bullet$ $E = \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1}\\frac{1}{(2n+1)^6}$ Consider the ratios $\\frac{B}{A}, \\frac{C}{A}, \\frac{D}{A}, \\frac{E}{A}$. Exactly one of the four is a rational number. Let that number be $r/s$, where $r$ and $s$ are nonnegative integers and $gcd \\,(r, s) = 1$. Concatenate $r, s$. (It might be helpful to know that $A = \\frac{\\pi^6}{945}$.) DL 10. (3 digits) You have a sheet of paper, which you lay on the xy plane so that its vertices are at $(-1, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, $(1, 100)$, $(-1, 100)$. You remove a section of the bottom of the paper by cutting along the function $y = f(x)$, where $f$ satisfies $f(1) = f(-1) = 0$. (In other words, you keep the bottom two vertices.) You do this again with another sheet of paper. Then you roll both of them into identical cylinders, and you realize that you can attach them to form an $L$-shaped elbow tube. We can write $f\\left( \\frac13 \\right)+f\\left( \\frac16 \\right) = \\frac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{\\pi c}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers and $b$ is square-free. $Find a+b+c$. DL 11.

(3 digits) Three cones have bases on the same plane, externally tangent to each other. The cones all face the same direction. Two of the cones have radii of $2$, and the other cone has a radius of $3$. The two cones with radii $2$ have height $4$, and the other cone has height $6$. Let $V$ be the volume of the tetrahedron with three of its vertices as the three vertices of the cones and the fourth vertex as the center of the base of the cone with height $6$. Find $V^2$. Down and to the right $e^{5\\pi i/3}$ DR 1. (2 digits) For some reason, people in math problems like to paint houses. Alice can paint a house in one hour. Bob can paint a house in six hours. If they work together, it takes them seven hours to paint a house. You might be thinking \"What? That's not right!\" but I did not make a mistake. When Alice and Bob work together, they get distracted very easily and simultaneously send text messages to each other. When they are texting, they are not getting any work done. When they are not texting, they are painting at their normal speeds (as if they were working alone). Carl, the owner of the house decides to check up on their work. He randomly picks a time during the seven hours. The probability that they are texting during that time can be written as $r/s$, where r and s are integers and $gcd \\,(r, s) = 1$. What is $r + s$? DR 4. (3 digits) Let $a_1 = 2 +\\sqrt2$ and $b_1 =\\sqrt2$, and for $n \\ge 1$, $a_{n+1} = |a_n - b_n|$ and $b_{n+1} = a_n + b_n$. The minimum value of $\\frac{a^2_n+a_nb_n-6b^2_n}{6b^2_n-a^2_n}$ can be written in the form $a\\sqrt{b} - c$, where $a, b, c$ are integers and $b$ is square-free. Concatenate $c, b, a$ (in that order!). DR 7. (3 digits) How many solutions are there to $a^{503} + b^{1006} = c^{2012}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers and $|a|$,$|b|$, $|c|$ are all less than $2012$?

    "text": "RulesTime Limit: 25 minutes Maximum Possible Score: 81 The following is a mathematical Sudoku puzzle which is also a crossword. Your job is to fill in as many blanks as you possibly can, including all shaded squares. You do not earn extra points for showing your work; the only points you get are for correctly filled-in squares. You get one point for each correctly filled-in square. You should read through the following rules carefully before starting. $\\bullet$ Your time limit for this round is $25$ minutes, in addition to the five minutes you get for reading the rules. So make use of your time wisely. The round is based more on speed than on perfect reasoning, so use your intuition well, and be fast. $\\bullet$ This is a Sudoku puzzle; all the squares should be filled in with the digits $1$ through $9$ so that every row and column contains each digit exactly once. In addition, each of the nine $3\\times 3$ boxes that compose the grid also contains each digit exactly once. Furthermore, this is a super-Sudoku puzzle; in addition to satisfying all these conditions, the four $3\\times 3$ boxes with red outlines also contain each of $1,..., 9$ exactly once. This last property is important to keep in mind – it may help you solve the puzzle faster. $\\bullet$ Just to restate the idea, you can use the digits $1$ through $9$, but not $0$. You may not use any other symbol, such as $\\pi$ or $e$ or $\\epsilon$. Each square gets exactly one digit. $\\bullet$ The grid is also a crossword puzzle; the usual rules apply. The shaded grey squares are the “black” squares of an ordinary crossword puzzle. The white squares as well as the shaded yellow ones count as the “white” crossword squares. All squares, white or shaded, count as ordinary Sudoku squares. $\\bullet$ If you obtain the unique solution to the crossword puzzle, then this solution extends to a unique solution to the Sudoku puzzle. $\\bullet$ You may use a graphing calculator to help you solve the clues. The following hints and tips may prove useful while solving the puzzle. $\\bullet$ Use the super-Sudoku structure described in the first rule; use all the symmetries you have. Remember that we are not looking for proofs or methods, only for correctly filled-in squares. $\\bullet$ If you find yourself stuck on a specific clue, it is nothing to worry about. You can obtain the solution to that clue later on by solving other clues and figuring out certain digits of your desired solution. Just move on to the rest of the puzzle. $\\bullet$ As you progress through the puzzle, keep filling in all squares you have found on your solution sheet, including the shaded ones. Remember that for scoring, the shaded grey squares count the same as the white ones. Good luck! Across 1 Across. The following is a normal addition where each letter represents a (distinct) digit: $$GOT + TO + GO + TO = TOP$$This certainly does not have a unique solution. However, you discover suddenly that $G = 2$ and $P \\notin \\{4, 7\\}$. Then what is the numeric value of the expression $GOT \\times TO$? 3 Across. A strobogrammatic number which reads the same upside down, e.g. $619$. On the other hand, a triangular number is a number of the form $n(n + 1)/2$ for some $n \\in N$, e.g. $15$ (therefore, the $i^{th}$ triangular number $T_i$ is the sum of $1$ through $i$). Let $a$ be the third strobogrammatic prime number. Let $b$ be the smaller number of the smallest pair of triangular numbers whose sum and difference are also triangular numbers. What is the value of $ab$? 6 Across. A positive integer $m$ is said to be palindromic in base $\\ell$ if, when written in base $\\ell$, its digits are the same front-to-back and back-to-front. For $j, k \\in N$, let $\\mu (j, k)$ be the smallest base-$10$ integer that is palindromic in base $j$ as well as in base$ k$, and let $\\nu (j, k):= (j + k) \\cdot \\mu (j, k)$. Find the value of $\\nu (5, 9)$. 7 Across. Suppose you have the unique solution to this Sudoku puzzle. In that solution, let $X$ denote the sum of all digits in the shaded grey squares. Similarly, let $Y$ denote the sum of all numbers in the shaded yellow squares on the upper left block (i.e. the $3 \\times 3$ box outlined red towards the top left). Concatenate $X$ with $Y$ in that order, and write that down. 8 Across. For any $n \\in N$ such that $1 < n < 10$, define the sequence $X_{n,1}$,$X_{n,2}$,$...$ by $X_{n,1} = n$, and for $r \\ge 2$, X_{n,r} is smallest number $k \\in N$ larger than X_{n,r-1} such that $k$ and the sum of digits of $k$ are both powers of $n$. For instance, $X_{3,1 = 3}$, $X_{3,2} = 9$, $X_{3,3} = 27$, and so on. Concatenate $X_{2,2}$ with $X_{2,4}$, and write down the answer. 9 Across. Find positive integers $x, y,z$ satisfying the following properties: $y$ is obtained by subtracting $93$ from $x$, and $z$ is obtained by subtracting $183$ from $y$, furthermore, $x, y$ and $z$ in their base-$10$ representations contain precisely all the digits from $1$ through $9$ once (i.e. concatenating $x, y$ and $z$ yields a valid $9$-digit Sudoku answer). Obviously, write down the concatenation of $x, y$ and $z$ in that order. 11 Across. Find the largest pair of two-digit consecutive prime numbers $a$ and $b$ (with $a < b$) such that the sum of the digits of a plus the sum of the digits of b is also a prime number. Write the concatenation of $a$ and $b$. 12 Across. Suppose you have a strip of $2n + 1$ squares, with n frogs on the $n$ squares on the left, and $n$ toads on the $n$ squares on the right. A move consists either of a toad or a frog sliding to an adjacent square if it is vacant, or of a toad or a frog jumping one square over another one and landing on the next square if it is vacant. For instance, the starting position has the position or the position as results of valid first moves. What is the minimum number of moves needed to swap the toads with the frogs if $n = 5$? How about $n = 6$? Concatenate your answers. 15 Across. Let $w$ be the largest number such that $w$, $2w$ and $3w$ together contain every digit from $1$ through $9$ exactly once. Let $x$ be the smallest integer with the property that its first $5$ multiples contain the digit $9$. A Leyland number is an integer of the form $m^n + n^m$ for integers $m, n > 1$. Let $y$ be the fourth Leyland number. A Pillai prime is a prime number $p$ for which there is an integer $n > 0$ such that $n! \\equiv - 1 (mod \\,\\, p)$, but $p \\not\\equiv 1 (mod \\,\\, n)$. Let $z$ be the fourth Pillai prime. Concatenate $w$, $x, y$ and $z$ in that order to obtain a permutation of $1,..., 9$. Write down this permutation. 19 Across. A hoax number $k \\in N$ is one for which the sum of its digits (in base $10$) equals the sum of the digits of its distinct prime factors (in base $10$). For instance, the distinct prime factors of $22$ are $2$ and $11$, and we have $2+2 = 2+(1+1)$. In fact, $22$ is the first hoax number. What is the second? 20 Across. Let $a, b$ and $c$ be distinct $2$-digit numbers satisfying the following properties: – $a$ is the largest integer expressible as $a = x^y = y^x$, for distinct integers $x$ and $y$. – $b$ is the smallest integer which has three partitions into three parts, which all give the same product (which turns out to be $1200$) when multiplied. – $c$ is the largest number that is the sum of the digits of its cube. Concatenate $a, b$ and $c$, and write down the resulting 6-digit prime number. 21 Across. Suppose $N = \\underline{a}\\, \\underline{b} \\, \\underline{c} \\, \\underline{d}$ is a $4$-digit number with digits $a, b, c$ and $d$, such that $N = a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d^7$. Find $N$. 22 Across. What is the smallest number expressible as the sum of $2, 3, 4$, or $5$ distinct primes? Down 1 Down. For some $a, b, c \\in N$, let the polynomial $$p(x) = x^5 - 252x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + cx - 62604360$$have five distinct roots that are positive integers. Four of these are 2-digit numbers, while the last one is single-digit. Concatenate all five roots in decreasing order, and write down the result. 2 Down. Gene, Ashwath and Cosmin together have $2511$ math books. Gene now buys as many math books as he already has, and Cosmin sells off half his math books. This leaves them with $2919$ books in total. After this, Ashwath suddenly sells off all his books to buy a private jet, leaving Gene and Cosmin with a total of $2184$ books. How many books did Gene, Ashwath and Cosmin have to begin with? Concatenate the three answers (in the order Gene, Ashwath, Cosmin) and write down the result. 3 Down. A regular octahedron is a convex polyhedron composed of eight congruent faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle; four of them meet at each vertex. For instance, the following diagram depicts a regular octahedron: Let $T$ be a regular octahedron of edge length $28$. What is the total surface area of $T$, rounded to the nearest integer? 4 Down. Evaluate the value of the expression $$\\sum^{T_{25}}_{k=T_{24}+1}k, $$where $T_i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ triangular number (the sum of the integers from $1$ through $i$). 5 Down. Suppose $r$ and $s$ are consecutive multiples of$ 9$ satisfying the following properties: – $r$ is the smallest positive integer that can be written as the sum of $3$ positive squares in $3$ different ways. – $s$ is the smallest $2$-digit number that is a Woodall number as well as a base-$10$ Harshad number. A Woodall number is any number of the form $n \\cdot 2^n - 1$ for some $n \\in N$. A base-$10$ Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits in base $10$. Concatenate $r$ and $s$ and write down the result. 10 Down. For any $k \\in N$, let $\\phi_p(k)$ denote the sum of the distinct prime factors of $k$. Suppose $N$ is the largest integer less than $50000$ satisfying $\\phi_p(N) =\\phi_p(N + 1)$, where the common value turns out to be a meager $55$. What is$ N$? 13 Down. The $n^{th}$ $s$-gonal number $P(s, n)$ is defined as $$P(s, n) = (s - 3)T_{n-1} + T_n$$where $T_i$ is the $i^{th}$ triangular number (recall that the $i^{th}$ triangular number is the sum of the numbers $1$ through $i$). Find the least $N$ such that $N$ is both a $34$-gonal number, and a $163$-gonal number. 14 Down. A biprime is a positive integer that is the product of precisely two (not necessarily distinct) primes. A cluster of biprimes is an ordered triple $(m,m + 1,m + 2)$ of consecutive integers that are biprimes. There are precisely three clusters of biprimes below 100. Denote these by, say, $$\\{(p, p + 1, p + 2), (q, q + 1,q + 2), (r, r + 1, r + 2)\\}$$and add the condition that $p + 2 < q < r - 2$ to fix the three clusters. Interestingly, $p + 1$ and $q$ are both multiples of $17$. Concatenate $q$ with $p + 1$ in that order, and write down the result. 16 Down. Find the least positive integer $m$ (written in base $10$ as $m = \\underline{a} \\, \\underline{b} \\, \\underline{c} $, with digits $a, b,c$), such that $m = (b + c)^a$. 17 Down. Let $X$ be a set containing $32$ elements, and let $Y\\subseteq X$ be a subset containing $29$ elements. How many $2$-element subsets of $X$ are there which have nonempty intersection with $Y$? 18 Down. Find a positive integer $K < 196$, which is a strange twin of the number $196$, in the sense that $K^2$ shares the same digits as $196^2$, and $K^3$ shares the same digits as $196^3$. PS.

The other is the POP command, upon which the cow in the lowest position on the $y$ axis moves to the positive $x$ axis.

    "text": "The seven dwarves are at work on day when they find a large pile of diamonds. They want to split the diamonds evenly among them, but find that they would need to take away one diamond to split into seven equal piles. They are still arguing about this when they get home, so Snow White sends them to bed without supper. In the middle of the night, Sneezy wakes up and decides that he should get the extra diamond. So he puts one diamond aside, splits the remaining ones in to seven equal piles, and takes his pile along with the extra diamond. Then, he runs off with the diamonds. His sneeze wakes up Grumpy, who, thinking along the same lines, removes one diamond, divides the remainder into seven equal piles, and runs off. Finally, Sleepy, for the first time in his life, wakes up before sunrise and performs the same operation. When the remaining four dwarves arise, they find that the remaining diamonds can be split into $5$ equal piles. Doc suggests that Snow White should get a share, so they have no problem splitting the remaining diamonds. Happy, Dopey, Bashful, Doc, and Snow White live happily ever after. What’s the smallest possible number of diamonds that the dwarves could have started out with?",

The expected value of the dimension of a random face of the unit $ 8$-hypercube (where the dimension of a face can be any value between $0$ and $N$) can be written in the form $p/q$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.
