        "solution": "Context I got 59 points in contest doing this problem all by myself the highest of any team (yes flex) (my greatest accomplishment) (we won TCS overall) \n \n Most proofs are highly unrigorous given the time limit Outline of my solution in contest including a little bit of my thought process Since I knew everyone else would go for the first two problems I decided to go to this one For the first 50 minutes I completely regretted this decision At first sight the problem looks super intimidating I began by reading the problem Then reading it again Then getting distracted and reading it again After a while (around 20 minutes probably because I kept getting distracted) I was able to understand the notation In fact under the $G(n k r (p_1 \\dots p_n))$ I wrote \"num doors num turns num rounds probabilities\" to help me remember the notation better Throughout the problems assume that any provided constructions for probabilities can be permuted by symmetry I began with the first subproblem (3 points) Show that $G(3 1 1 (p_1 p_2 p_3))$ can be less than $1$ For this I tested a few probabilities and came to the following lemma When opening two doors with probabilities $p$ and $q$ the unopened door will get weighted by a factor of $2$ In other words the remaining probabilities will be $0 2p$ or $0 2q$ scaled so that the sum of all the probabilities is still $1$ This is easy to prove by conditional probability concepts This is sufficient to solve this problem and (iirc) the example I came up with was $\\left(\\frac12 \\frac13 \\frac16\\right)$ \n \n The next subproblem (3 points) was to show that $G(n n 2 1 (p_1 \\dots p_n))$ can be less than $1$ for all $n \\geq 3$ \n \n For this I made the following claim Claim It is always optimal to open the doors with the smallest probabilities The reason for this is because if we want to maximize $F$ then we need all the probabilities to be as close to each other as possible In my proof I didn't really account for the case where we might want to make them farther apart temporarily then make them closer later However I assumed that this would just be a simple yet annoying edge case check so I didn't mention it At this point I realized that the problem would be simplest if after combining two doors the sum of the probabilities remained the same This would imply that the doors combined must have the same probability This gave me the idea for the following solution We can simply take the probabilities $\\left(\\frac 12 \\frac 13 \\frac 16 \\frac 1{12} \\dots \\frac{1}{6\\cdot 2^{n 2}} \\frac{1}{6\\cdot 2^{n 2}}\\right)$ and combining the smallest two probabilities will collapse into a case with $n \\mapsto n 1$ since the sum of all the probabilities remains the same The next subproblem (3 points) was to show that $G(3 1 1 (p_1 p_2 p_3))$ can be $1$ This is easy to do with $\\left(\\frac12 \\frac14 \\frac14\\right)$ \n \n The next subproblem (10 points) is to show that there exists a tuple $(n k 1 (p_1 \\dots p_n))$ with $n>2024 k>506$ such that for all increasing $k'$ from $1$ to $k$ increases $G(n k' 1 (p_1 \\dots p_n))$ and the value is $1$ when $k'=k$ \n \n For this I simply noted that when the probabilities are $\\left(\\frac12 \\frac14 \\dots \\frac1{2^{n 1}} \\frac1{2^{n 1}}\\right)$ and there are no more turns then the final score is $\\frac{n}{2^{n 1}}$ Since each turn decreases $n$ we can simply take this set of probabilities for sufficiently large $n > k > 2025$ This is because the probability increases as $n$ increases until we reach $n=2$ \n \n At this point I tried to get some of my team members to help me to no avail Three of them were working on the problem one construction two on the bound and two more were working on problem 2 The next subproblem (6 points) Determine when $G(4 k r (p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4)) = r$ \n \n I immediately thought to do casework on $r$ we are given that $rk+1 < n$ Therefore we check when $r=2$ so $k=1$ Then we require that after $1$ turn the probabilities are all equal and after another turn the probabilities are once again all equal However in one turn the probabilities $\\left(\\frac13 \\frac13 \\frac13\\right)$ can only be turned into $\\left(\\frac13 \\frac23\\right)$ \n \n Therefore we must instead have $r=1$ The set of probabilities which can be reduced to $\\left(\\frac13 \\frac13 \\frac13\\right)$ in exactly one move consists only of $\\left(\\frac13 \\frac13 \\frac16 \\frac16\\right)$ Note that in this case $k$ can be either $1$ or $2$ To reduce to $\\left(\\frac12 \\frac12\\right)$ in exactly two moves we must have $\\left(\\frac12 \\frac14 \\frac18 \\frac18\\right)$ and $k=2$ \n \n Now we continue to the problem of showing when $G(n k r (p_1 \\dots p_n)) = r$ The points are as follows 5 points for $k=1$ \n 10 points for $k=2 r=1$ \n 20 points for $r=1$ with exactly $k$ turns per round \n 35 points for $r=1$ \n 55 points for $r=1 2$ \n 75 points for a full solution \n \n When I saw these scoring guidelines I only had around 15 minutes left I first tried $k=1$ thinking that the lack of a restriction on $r$ is strange Of course it turns out this case is trivial I quickly realized $r$ must be $1$ simply because you cannot go from one position of all equal probabilities to another position of all equal probabilities in one turn I then decided to try $r=1$ My conjecture for this based on previous problems is simply to modify the power of $2$ strategy from the $n=4$ case However I did not really provide a specific proof for this Specifically we could have some amount of equal probabilities then use the dividing by $2$ strategy constantly I here quickly realized that the 20 point case is isomorphic to the 35 point case because we can simply just take all the values of $k$ bigger than the exact number of turns necessary Anyways it took me 10 very unfortunate minutes to actually calculate the annoying values and indices Eventually the probabilities which can be collapsed into an all equal case in exactly $k$ turns is \n \n \\[\n\\left(\n\\frac{1}{n k+1} \\frac{1}{n k+1} \\dots \\frac{1}{n k+1} \\frac{1}{(n k+1)2} \\frac{1}{(n k+1)2^2} \\dots \\frac{1}{(n k+1)2^{k}} \\frac{1}{(n k+1)2^{k}}\n\\right)\n\\] where $\\frac{1}{n k+1}$ occurs $n k$ times Then for the 35 point case we can simply take anything larger than this $k$ as the new $k$ value to produce a valid tuple Once I did this I had around 5 minutes left but instead of trying to prove my unproven lemmas I wondered how it would be possible to go from one set of equal probabilities to another smaller set thereby giving an $r=2$ solution I came to the conclusion that the only way this is possible is if the $n k+1$ in the previous problem is even and we can combine pairs to form another equal configuration I was definitely unable to support this conclusion with any proof but nonetheless I wrote up my thoughts Clearly if this is true the general solution is much the same as $r=2$ \n \n We start with a configuration such as the tuple mentioned above and it suffices that $2^r$ divides $n k+1$ However in the contest I only had time to writeup my ideas for extending to $r=2$ I said that $n k+1$ would have to be even and we could combine in pairs and with no time remaining added that \"It is easy to extend this idea to larger $r$ \" \n \n If I ever decide to prove many of these claims rigorously I will definitely return",

But what if there is no (odd odd) point? We claim every column has even height then If $i$ is odd then $a_i$ must be even so even height If $i$ is even even columns cannot have odd height since then we must go horizontal by 1 to the next column which means the next column has an (odd odd) point!

        "solution": "This problem is mine and in fact it is the one I referred to in this blog post In the interest of the Contest Collections page I'll post the official solution Solution Before trudging onward it helps to deduce a few properties of any system of congruences which is valid First remark that the values of $\\pi(1)$ $\\pi(5)$ and $\\pi(7)$ are independent of values of other congruences In other words when building a valid permutation it suffices to compute the other six values and then randomly assign these three at the end Now remark that $\\pi(km)\\equiv\\pi(k)\\pmod k$ for all $k$ and $m$ for which the previous congruence is valid This is because the modulus of $N$ modulo $km$ determines the modulus of $N$ mod $k$ and so the results must be consistent The following consequences are direct colloraries of this fact All even indexes i e all $\\pi(2k)$ for $k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ must have the same parity For example $\\pi(2)\\equiv\\pi(8)\\pmod 2$ (The same is not necessarily true of the odds however in particular when $\\pi(2)$ is odd one of $\\pi(1)$ $\\pi(3)$ $\\ldots$ $\\pi(9)$ must also be odd This is a result of the fact that $9$ is itself odd ) \n As an extension $\\pi(8) \\pi(4)$ must be an integral multiple of $4$ Since $9 1=8$ we need either $|\\pi(8) \\pi(4)|=4$ or $|\\pi(8) \\pi(4)|=8 $ \n Note that $\\pi(3)\\equiv\\pi(6)\\equiv\\pi(9)\\pmod 3$ This in particular means that \\[\\{\\pi(3) \\pi(6) \\pi(9)\\}\\in\\{\\{1 4 7\\} \\{2 5 8\\} \\{3 6 9\\}\\} \\] Subject to all these conditions a solution exists by the Chinese Remainder Theorem on the moduli $5$ $7$ $8$ and $9$ \n \n We now have enough information to start counting We split the calculation into two cases $\\textbf{CASE 1 }\\pi(2k)\\equiv 0\\pmod 2$ $\\forall k$ In this case remark that $\\{\\pi(4) \\pi(8)\\}$ can only be one of $\\{2 6\\}$ or $\\{4 8\\}$ Noting the third bullet point above we see that in the former case we must have $\\pi(6)=4$ in the latter case we must have $\\pi(6)=6$ (why?) From these $\\pi(2)$ is uniquely determined and there are two ways to choose the ordered pair $(\\pi(3) \\pi(9))$ Thus in total there are $2\\times 2\\times 2=8$ possibilities in this case $\\textbf{CASE 2 }\\pi(2k)\\equiv 1\\pmod 2$ $\\forall k$ In this case there are more choices for the set $\\{\\pi(4) \\pi(8)\\}$ In fact there are four $\\{1 5\\}$ $\\{3 7\\}$ $\\{5 9\\}$ and $\\{1 9\\}$ Because of this we need to be more careful about how we enumerate the possible permutations which work We again split into two cases $\\textbf{SUBCASE 1 }\\{\\pi(4) \\pi(8)\\} = \\{1 5\\}$ or $\\{5 9\\}$ Note that in these cases there are two possible values of $\\pi(6)$ in the first one $\\pi(6)\\in\\{3 9\\}$ while in the second $\\pi(6)\\in\\{1 7\\}$ Regardless of which member of which set is chosen the other element in the set must also appear as some other element in $\\{\\pi(3) \\pi(9)\\}$ For example if $\\pi(6)=1$ then either $\\pi(3)=7$ or $\\pi(9)=7$ Combining this with the fact that all $\\pi(2k)$ have the same parity we see that $\\pi(2)$ is actually fixed in these situations Thus for each of the four possibilities for $(\\pi(4) \\pi(8))$ there are two possible values of $\\pi(6)$ and two possibilities for $(\\pi(3) \\pi(9))$ for $16$ different permutations which work $\\textbf{SUBCASE 2 }\\{\\pi(4) \\pi(8)\\} = \\{3 7\\}$ or $\\{1 9\\}$ In contrast with the above note that in these two cases $\\pi(6)$ is fixed which means there the value of $\\pi(2)$ can vary More specifically for each of the four possibilities for $(\\pi(4) \\pi(8))$ there are two possible values for $\\pi(2)$ and two possibilities for $(\\pi(3) \\pi(9))$ for $16$ different permutations which work Thus in this total case $32$ systems are possible Finally there are three numbers left and they can be assigned to $\\pi(1)$ $\\pi(5)$ and $\\pi(7)$ in $3!=6$ ways Thus the total number of consistent systems is $6(8+32)=\\boxed{240}$",
