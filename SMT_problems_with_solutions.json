a_2^3=n=p^e$ \n This means that $p^3 1$ is a power of $p$ which is impossible Solution $a_2$ must be the smallest prime factor of $n$ Suppose $a_3$ is a prime number Then $ a_2^3\\equiv {a_3}^3 {a_2}^3\\equiv n\\equiv 0\\pmod{a_3}\\implies a_2\\equiv 0\\pmod{a_3}$ which contradicts $a_2$ being prime and distinct from $a_3$ Then it must be the case that $a_3=a_2^2$ We have $n=a_3^3 a_2^3=(a_2^2)^3 a_2^3=a_2^3(a_2^3 1)=a_2^3(a_2 1)(a_2^2+a_2+1)$ If $a_2>2$ then $a_2 1>1$ and has a prime factor This prime factor must be less than $a_2$ But it is also a factor of $n$ which

        "solution": "I will edit new solutions in if I find them S1 $A$ is the point $( 29 841)$ and $B$ is the point $(51 2601)$ The line connecting them is $y=22x+1479$ So the $y$ coordinate of $C$

area S3 (I forgot the exact formulation of Pick's Theorem so I checked for this problem) Let $A$ be the point at $(0 0)$ $B$ be the point at $(0 20)$ and $C$ be the point at $(18 0)$ The number of lattice points on $\\overline{AB}$ is $21$ the number of lattice points on $\\overline{BC}$ is $3$ namely $(0 20)$ $(9 10)$ and $(18 0)$ and the number of lattice points on $\\overline{CA}$ is $19$ The number of points on the boundary of $\\triangle{ABC}$ is then $21+3+19 3=40$ because we need to account for double counting The altitude from $C$ to $\\overline{AB}$ is $18$ so $[ABC]=\\frac{AB\\cdot 18}{2}=\\frac{20\\cdot 18}{2}=180$ If there are $a$ interior points of $\\triangle{ABC}$ then by Pick's Theorem $a+\\frac{40}{2} 1=180\\iff a=161$ So the number of points in the interior or on the boundary of $\\triangle{ABC}$ is $161+40=201$ \n S4 Old concern about P4 I am not sure how this is possible I have this much Suppose $n$ has more than $1$ prime factor Let its smallest prime factors then be $a$ and $b$ with $a<b$ It must be the case that $a_2=a$ and $a_3=b$ Then $ a^3\\equiv b^3 a^3\\equiv a_3^3 a_2^3\\equiv n\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}\\implies a\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$ which contradicts $a$ being prime and distinct from $b$ Thus $n$ has only $1$ prime factor Let $p$ be this prime factor and let $e$ be such that $p^e=n$ We have $p^3(p^3 1)=(p^2)^3 p^3=a_3^3 a_2^3=n=p^e$ \n This means that $p^3 1$ is a power of $p$ which is impossible Solution $a_2$ must be the smallest prime factor of $n$ Suppose $a_3$ is a prime number Then $ a_2^3\\equiv {a_3}^3 {a_2}^3\\equiv n\\equiv 0\\pmod{a_3}\\implies a_2\\equiv 0\\pmod{a_3}$ which contradicts $a_2$ being prime and distinct from $a_3$ Then it must be the case that $a_3=a_2^2$ We have $n=a_3^3 a_2^3=(a_2^2)^3 a_2^3=a_2^3(a_2^3 1)=a_2^3(a_2 1)(a_2^2+a_2+1)$ If $a_2>2$ then $a_2 1>1$ and has a prime factor This prime factor must be less than $a_2$ But it is also a factor of $n$ which contradicts $a_2$ being the smallest prime factor of $n$ Thus $a_2 1=1\\implies a_2=2$ and $n=a_3^3 a_2^3=(2^2)^3 2^3=64 8=56$ \n S6 Consider the circumcircle of this polygon By the Inscribed Right
