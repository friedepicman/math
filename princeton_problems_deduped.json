If $\\ r+1=3,r=2=3t^3+3t^2+t $ , if we solve the equation, we can see again there is no integer solution.  Case 2:   $\\ gcd(3t,3t^2+3t+1)=1$ so if $\\ 3t=r $ and $\\ 3t^2+3t+1=r+1$ we get $\\ r=0=3t, t=0 $  If $\\ t=0,m=1 $ and $\\ y=2 $   $$\\ (x, y) =(2, 2)$$ If $\\ 3t=r+1 $ and $\\ r=3t^2+3t+1 $ we see there is no integer solution.  So there is just one integer solution,   $$\\ (x, y) = (2,2)$$",

He can stop when he cannot fit the next perfect square on the board. (At the end, there might be some space left on the board - he does not write only part of the next perfect square.)

(4 digits) I have a random number machine generator that is very good at generating integers between $1$ and , $256$ , inclusive, with equal probability. However, right now, I want to produce a random number between $1$ and , $n$ , inclusive, so I do the following:   $\\bullet$ I use my machine to generate a number between $1$ and . $256$ Call this . $a$   $\\bullet$ I take a and divide it by $n$ to get remainder . $r$ If , $r \\ne 0$ , then I record $r$ as the randomly generated number. If , $r = 0$ , then I record $n$ instead.  Note that this process does not necessarily produce all numbers with equal probability, but that is okay.

(5 digits) You and your friend play the following dangerous game. You two start off at some point $(x, y)$ on the plane, where $x$ and $y$ are nonnegative integers.  When it is player ' $A$ ' s turn, A tells his opponent $B$ to move to another point on the plane. Then $A$ waits for a while. If $B$ is not eaten by a tiger, then $A$ moves to that point as well.  From a point $(x, y)$ there are three places $A$ can tell $B$ to walk to: leftwards to , $(x - 1, y)$ , downwards to , $(x, y-1)$ , and simultaneously downwards and leftwards to . $(x-1, y-1)$ However, you cannot move to a point with a negative coordinate.  Now, what was this about being eaten by a tiger? There is a tiger at the origin, which will eat the first person that goes there! Needless to say, you lose if you are eaten.  Consider all possible starting points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\le x \\le 346$ and , $0 \\le y \\le 346$ , and $x$ and $y$ are not both zero.

DR 1. (2 digits) For some reason, people in math problems like to paint houses. Alice can paint a house in one hour. Bob can paint a house in six hours. If they work together, it takes them seven hours to paint a house. You might be thinking \"What? That's not right!\" but I did not make a mistake.  When Alice and Bob work together, they get distracted very easily and simultaneously send text messages to each other. When they are texting, they are not getting any work done.  When they are not texting, they are painting at their normal speeds (as if they were working alone). Carl, the owner of the house decides to check up on their work.

The denominator is simple enough as it will be $11^{n-1}$ for some arbitrary . $n$ Finding the numerator will much more difficult but we can note a certain pattern:   $$n = 2 \\Rightarrow 2; n = 3 \\Rightarrow 2 \\cdot 11 + 3; n = 4 \\Rightarrow 2 \\cdot 11^2 + 3 \\cdot 11  +4$$ So we now see that the numerator, call it , $S$ , is defined by . $S = \\sum_{k = 2}^{n} \\big( k \\cdot 11^{n-k} \\big)$ We must find a general expression for this sum now, in terms of . $n$ Note that   $$ S = 2 \\cdot 11^{n-2} + 3 \\cdot 11^{n-3} + 4 \\cdot 11^{n-4} + \\cdots + (n-1)\\cdot 11 + n $$ $$ \\frac{1}{11}S = 2 \\cdot 11^{n-3} + 3 \\cdot 11^{n-4} + 4 \\cdot 11^{n-5} + \\cdots + (n-1) + \\frac{n}{11}  $$ So we subtract the second from the first to get:   $$ \\frac{10}{11} S = (2 \\cdot 11^{n-2} - \\frac{n}{11} ) + (1 + 11 + \\cdots 11^{n-3})$$ This is finally something we can easily work with.

The main claim is that . $f(n) = \\tbinom{n}{2} (2f(n-1) + (n-1) f(n-2))$    There are $\\tbinom{n}{2}$ ways to place $2$ rooks in the first row.

If $A$ and $B$ lie in the same row , $n$ , then there are $n-1$ ways to choose column $n$ and $f(n-2)$ ways to place the rest of the rooks. This is because we can delete rows $1$ and $n$ and columns $1$ and , $2$ , leaving an empty $(n-2) \\times (n-2)$ grid, unaffected by the placements of the first $4$ rooks.    Now consider the $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ square grid sharing the bottom right corner of the $n \\times n$ grid. Then there are $f(n-1)$ ways place $2n-2$ rooks in that empty grid such that each rook attacks exactly $2$ rooks within the $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ grid.

        "solution": "Divide the $6 \\times 6$ grid into nine $2 \\times 2$ square grids. Clearly we can have at most $1$ black square in each $2 \\times 2$ square so each $2 \\times 2$ square has exactly $1$ black square. Now we can describe the position of the black square in the $2 \\times 2$ square as being on the left or right side and on the up or down half. We denote these as $L$ or $R$ and $U$ or $D$ respectively. The condition tells us that two consecutive black squares in a row cannot be $RL$ and two consecutive black squares in a column cannot be . $DU$ Then the only $4$ possibilities for a row (from left to right) are $LLL, LLR, LRR$ or . $RRR$ Similarly, the only $4$ possibilities for a column are $UUU, UUD, UDD$ or . $DDD$ Since there are $3$ rows and $3$ columns, the total number of configuration is . $4^{3+3} = 4096$    Unfortunately, not all of these work. Consider the corners of the middle $2 \\times 2$ square. We have to subtract the cases where one of these corners is shared by two black squares. We proceed with PIE. WLOG the top left corner is shared. There are two ways this can happen:    1. One black square in the top left $2 \\times 2$ square shares the corner with a black square in the center $2 \\times 2$ square. Then the top row must be $RRR$ because the first one is on the right. In the second row we have . $LL \\ \\_$ Since the middle square is $L$ the first one must also be . $L$ Then the third one can either be $L$ or . $R$ In the third row we can have any of the $4$ possibilities so there are $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$ ways to decide the left/right positions. We also see that there are $8$ ways to decide the up and down positions so there are $8^2=64$ ways to color the gird.    2. Once black square in the middle left $2 \\times 2$ square shares the corner with a black square in the middle top $2 \\times 2 $ square. Doing the same thing as in case , $1$ , we see that there are also $8^2=64$ ways to color the grid in this case.    Since there are $4$ corners, the total number of colorings that have a shared corner is . $4 \\cdot (64+64)=512$ Now we have to subtract the number of colorings where two of the corners are shared. We can either have the top right and the bottom left corners shared or the top left and the bottom right corners shared. WLOG the top left and the bottom right corners shared. Then it's easy to see that there are $2$ ways to choose which squares have black square's corners shared and $2^2=4$ ways to color the rest of the grid. Therefore, there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2^2=16$ overcounts. Therefore, the answer is . $4096-512+16 = \\boxed{3600}$",

        "solution": "I'm not sure which thread is the official thread, so I'll add my solution here as well.    We will show that the maximal number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an $n \\times n$ chessboard is $2n - 2.$ Moreover, there are precisely $2^n$ possible bishop placements.    From the top left square of the board, label the $2n - 1$ diagonals (with orientation $\\nearrow$ as opposed to ) $\\searrow$ )  $d_1, d_2, \\cdots, d_{2n - 1}.$ Clearly each diagonal can contain only one bishop, for if two bishops belonged to the same diagonal, these two would attack one another. Moreover, $d_1$ and $d_{2n - 1}$ cannot both contain bishops, because $d_1$ consists of only the top left square of the board and $d_{2n - 1}$ consists only of the bottom right square of the board. If a bishop belonged to each of these two squares, then these two bishops would attack one another. Hence, at most $2n - 2$ diagonals can contain bishops, establishing the desired bound. Now, we will show that this bound is attainable.    We claim that any bishop on the chessboard attacks at least $n - 1$ squares. Indeed, consider any bishop $B$ and let $d$ be a diagonal passing through $B.$ Let $B$ vary on , $d$ , and as $B$ varies, let $d'$ be the second diagonal passing through $B.$ If $|d|, |d'|$ denote the number of squares on , $d, d'$ , then the total number of squares attacked by $B$ is $(|d| - 1) + (|d'| - 1).$ However, $|d'| - 1$ is minimized when $d'$ is as short as possible. This clearly occurs when $B$ belongs the the side of the board. Moreover, it is easy to see that any bishop belonging to the side of the board attacks precisely $n - 1$ squares. Thus, any bishop attacks at least $n - 1$ squares, as desired.    Now, consider a non-corner square $s$ of the chessboard that does not contain a bishop. Since two diagonals pass through , $s$ , at most two bishops can attack $s$ (for otherwise, two bishops would belong to the same diagonal, and hence attack one another). Then if $2n - 2$ non-attacking bishops are placed on the chessboard, $n^2 - (2n - 2)$ square do not contain bishops. Therefore, the total number of times a bishop attacks a square is bounded above by $2(n^2 - 2n + 2).$ However, notice that each of the four corner squares can only be attacked by one bishop, not two. Since at least two corner squares are not occupied by a bishop, we may strengthen the above bound as $2(n^2 - 2n + 2) - 2.$ But since each bishop attacks at least $n - 1$ squares, the total number of times a bishop attacks a square is  bounded below by $(n - 1)(2n - 2) = 2(n^2 - 2n + 2) - 2.$ Therefore, equality must occur, in which case all $2n - 2$ bishops belong to the side of the board. It remains to count how many ways this can happen.    For $k = 2, 3, \\cdots , n - 1$ it is easy to see that there are exactly two ways in which the bishops belonging to $d_k$ and $d_{2n - k}$ can be placed so that these two bishops belong to the side of the board. Moreover, there are two ways in which the bishop in $d_n$ can be placed. Finally, there are two choices for whether $d_1$ or $d_{2n - 1}$ contains a bishop. Thus we have a total of $2^{n - 2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2^n$ possible bishop placements. $\\square$",

        "solution": "Before proceeding, first remark that we may reformulate the problem as a coloring problem: color each vertex with a set of colors such that two vertices are adjacent iff their color sets intersect.  This is sufficient because in the number theory interpretation we may assume WLOG all the labels are squarefree.    I claim the answer is $n = N$ for $N\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $n=\\lfloor\\tfrac{N^2}4\\rfloor$ otherwise.    First we show that this is necessary.  For , $N\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ , the graph with no edges suffices.  For , $N\\geq 4$ , let , $r = \\tfrac N2$ , and consider the bipartite graph . $G = K_{\\lfloor r\\rfloor, \\lceil r\\rceil}$ For each edge , $e\\in E(G)$ , let $\\mathcal C_e$ denote the set of colors which appear on both vertices of that edge.  Note that $\\mathcal C_e$ is nonempty.  Further remark that all ' $\\mathcal C_e$ ' s are disjoint.  Indeed, if there existed two edges $\\{a_1,b_1\\}$ and $\\{a_2,b_2\\}$ for which this intersection is nonempty, then at least three vertices would have the same color, implying the existence of a triangle in . $G$ It follows that the number of colors necessary is at least . $|E(G)| = \\lfloor\\tfrac{N^2}4\\rfloor$    Now we show this is sufficient.  We proceed by induction on . $N$ The base case of $N=4$ is tedious but not hard to check.  Now for the inductive step, assume the proposition for some , $N\\in\\mathbb N$ , and consider any graph $G$ on $N+1$ vertices.  Let $w$ be the vertex in $G$ of smallest degree.  We now case on the degree of . $w$   First suppose that,and label the vertices in the neighborhood ofby the labels.Removeand all edges connecting toto form a new graph.By the induction hypothesis,can be colored incolors.  Now when addingback in, we may usenew colors (unless,in which case we use one new color), where thenew color is applied to verticesand;it is clear that this new coloring works.  As a result, we have used at mostcolors, and so this case is satisfied.Now suppose that,and consider the graphformed by only the edges connecting two elements in.The crucial claim is that there are at mostconnected components in this graph.  It is sufficient to show that the degree of each vertex in this graph is at least,for then each connected component has size at least.To prove this, letbe arbitrary, and consider the neighborhoodofin.If for the sake of contradiction,then we obtain the inequalitycontradiction.  Henceandshare a common neighbor,and so.As a result, when doing the same inductive process as in the first case, we can add at mostcolors, one for each connected component in.  First suppose that,and label the vertices in the neighborhood ofby the labels.Removeand all edges connecting toto form a new graph.By the induction hypothesis,can be colored incolors.  Now when addingback in, we may usenew colors (unless,in which case we use one new color), where thenew color is applied to verticesand;it is clear that this new coloring works.

Now when adding $w$ back in, we may use $d$ new colors (unless , $d=0$ , in which case we use one new color), where the $k^{\\text{th}}$ new color is applied to vertices $w$ and ; $w_k$ ; it is clear that this new coloring works.  As a result, we have used at most   \\[ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{N^2}4\\right\\rfloor + d \\leq \\left\\lfloor\\frac{N^2}4\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{N+1}2\\right\\rfloor \\leq \\left\\lfloor\\frac{(N+1)^2}4\\right\\rfloor  \\] colors, and so this case is satisfied.  Now suppose that,and consider the graphformed by only the edges connecting two elements in.The crucial claim is that there are at mostconnected components in this graph.  It is sufficient to show that the degree of each vertex in this graph is at least,for then each connected component has size at least.To prove this, letbe arbitrary, and consider the neighborhoodofin.If for the sake of contradiction,then we obtain the inequalitycontradiction.

I will prove a generalization.  Say two permutations intersect if they share a number in the same place, as per the JMO notation.    Given permutations of ${1,...2n}$ I claim that the minimal number of permutations needed such that every other permutation intersects at least one is . $n+1$ To prove this, just consider the permutations , ${1,2,...n+1,n+2,..2n}$ ,  , ${2,3,...n+1,1,n+2,...2n}$ , ... , ${n+1,1,...n,n+2,...2n}$ , the $n+1$ permutations where the first $n$ are cyclically permuted.  Clearly a permutation that does not intersect this has to have all of its , $1$ ,  , $2$ , ... $n+1$ among the last $n-1$ terms, impossible.  The JMO problem is just the $n=1005$ case of this direction.    Now, we show that given any $n$ permutations there exists one that does not intersect it.  Examine what numbers are allowed to go where in a permutation that doesn't intersect ant of these . $2n$ We represent the $2n$ numbers by boys, and note that any number is allowed to go in at least $n$ spaces - the $n$ permutations have that number in at most $n$ different spaces, so at least $n$ are left.  Now, any space is allowed to have at least $n$ numbers for the same reason - at most $n$ are used up in the permutations.  These spaces are girls.  We have $2n$ boys and $2n$ girls, and everyone likes at least $n$ people of the opposite gender.  In a set of $1 \\le k \\le n$ boys clearly they like at least $n$ girls.  Since every girl likes at least $n$ boys, a set of at least $n+1$ boys will be liked by all girls.  So then by Hall's marriage lemma, we can find a perfect matching between spaces and numbers.  This gives rise to a permutation that does not intersect the existing one.    Therefore, $n+1$ is the minimal number of permutations needed such that any permutation intersects at least one of them.  The case $n=1007$ yields our result.",

Clearly, the number of divisors in cases 2, 3, and 4 are divisible by 2010, so those go away, so our answer will bemod 2010.  NowSomod 2010. Note that . $2010^{2010} = 2^{2010} \\cdot 3^{2010} \\cdot 5^{2010} \\cdot 67^{2010}$ We're interested in the units digit; anything multiplied by 5 will either have units digit 5 or 0, so we omit 5.

If , $n=2$ , we must have , $|b-a|\\leq 3$ , becasue otherwise $n^{a}+1$ and $n^{b}+1$ don't have the same number of digits either.

Thus we need to consider $6^{a}+6^{a+1}$ and $9^{a}+9^{a+1}$ modulo . $11$  An easy calculation shows that these numbers are nver equal to $-2$ modulo $11$ and so these $n$ cannot be a solution to the original problem.",

Case 1: Case 1:  $f(-1) = 0$    Putting in , $h = -2$ ,  $k = 1$ gives . $f(-2) = f(1)f(-2) + 1$ Putting in $h = k = -1$ gives . $f(-2) + f(1) = 1$ Substituting, we have , $f(-2) = f(1)f(-2) + f(-2) + f(1)$ , so either $f(1) = 0$ or . $f(-2) = -1$     Subcase 1: Subcase 1:  $f(1) = 0$    Putting into (*) gives . $f(h + 1) + f(h) = 1$ Since , $f(1) = 0$ ,  , $f(2) = 1$ ,  , $f(3) = 0$ , and so on, so $f(\\text{odd number}) = 0$ and . $f(\\text{even number}) = 1$ This is 1 function.     Subcase 2: Subcase 2:  $f(-2) = -1$    If so, then putting into $f(-2) + f(1) = 1$ gives . $f(1) = 2$ Putting into (*) gives . $f(h + 1) = f(h) + 1$  $h$ must be an integer, so the function that works is , $f(x) = x + C$ , with $C$ being a constant.  Since , $f(-2) = -1$ ,  . $C = 1$ This is another function.     Case 2: Case 2:  $f(1) = 1$    Putting into (*) gives , $f(h + 1) = 1$ , so . $f(x) = 1$ This is another function.

Notice that $p >45$ as , $p=a^4+b^4+c^4 - 3 \\geq 2^4+2^4+2^4 - 3 = 45$ , so $a^4+b^4+c^4-3$ must be odd.    This requires that exactly $1$ or $3$ of $a,b,c$ are even.

Therefore, $c=3$ and , $p=3^4+638 = 719$ , which is indeed prime. This finishes the case.

To count this, we have some options    1) $(x-2520)$ has a factor of , $2$ ,  $(y-2520)$ has a factor of $2^5$  2) $(x-2520)$ has a factor of , $2^2$ ,  $(y-2520)$ has a factor of $2^4$  3) $(x-2520)$ has a factor of , $2^3$ ,  $(y-2520)$ has a factor of $2^3$  4) $(x-2520)$ has a factor of , $2^4$ ,  $(y-2520)$ has a factor of $2^2$  5) $(x-2520)$ has a factor of , $2^5$ ,  $(y-2520)$ has a factor of $2$    In each of these cases, there are $5\\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 45$ ways to divy up the remaining factors of $2520^2$ among $(x-2520)$ and . $(y-2520)$ So the answer is . $7\\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 - 5\\cdot 5\\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 =2 \\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 3 = 90$",

This problem was surprisingly difficult.  It took me a really long time to figure out how to get integrals that actually converged.  There are many different expressions that you can come up with to represent the same areas, and many different limits of integration you can choose, but only one combination of all these formulas and limits of integration leads to convergence.  I'm still not 100% sure why it should actually matter which order you integrate in, but anyway, here goes:    We choose $A = (x_a, y_a)$ randomly in the square and draw the line from $(0, 0)$ to . $A$ The equation of this line is:     $L_1: y = \\frac{y_a}{x_a}x$    Next, we draw the line passing through points $(1, 0)$ and . $A$ The equation of this line is:     $L_2: y = \\frac{y_a}{1-x_a}(1-x)$    For a fixed , $A$ , the line segment from any other point $B$ to $(1, 0)$ will intersect with $L_1$ if and only if $B$ is in the interior of the region bounded on the right by the lines , $L_1$ ,  , $L_2$ , and on the left by the edge of the square.  Thus, for a fixed , $A$ , the probability of choosing such a $B$ is given by the area under this region.    We need to consider two cases:     Case 1: Case 1: When , $y < 1-x$ , this region is a simple triangle whose base is on the - $y$ - axis.  The length of the base is given by , $\\frac{y_a}{1-x_a}$ , and the height of the triangle is given simply by . $x_a$ Hence the area of this triangle is given by . $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{x_a y_a}{1-x_a}$ To find the total probability for all possible choices of , $A$ , we integrate over the lower left portion of the unit square.  This is given by:     $P_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1-x} \\frac{y x}{1-x} dy dx$     $= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x}{1-x} \\left[\\frac{y^2}{2}\\right]^{1-x}_{0} dx$     $= \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{1} x(1-x) dx$     $= \\frac{1}{24}$    Note that the order of integration here is important.  If we integrate with respect to $x_a$ first, we will get an expression involving a logarithm which will diverge over the limits of integration.  But by integrating with respect to $y_a$ first, the denominators cancel out.     Case 2 Case 2 : When , $y > 1-x$ , the problem is more difficult because the shape of the region is a trapezoid instead of a triangle.    First, let $K$ be the point of intersection of $L_1$ and the line , $y=1$ , and note that . $K = \\left(\\frac{x_a}{y_a}, 1\\right)$ Let $J$ be the point of intersection of $L_2$ and the line , $y=1$ , and we calculate . $J = \\left(1-\\frac{1-x_a}{y_a}, 1\\right)$ Also let $O$ be the origin, and . $P = (0,1)$ The region we are trying to find the area of is trapezoid , $OPJA$ , and is given by the area of triangle $OPK$ minus the area of triangle . $KJA$ There are other ways to compute the area of this region as well, but they lead to expressions which result in non-converging integrals.    Triangle $KJA$ has base $\\frac{x_a}{y_a} - \\left(1-\\frac{1-x_a}{y_a}\\right) = \\frac{1}{y_a} - 1$ and height , $1-y_a$ , so its area is given by $\\frac{1}{2}(1-y_a)\\left(\\frac{1-y_a}{y_a}\\right)$    Triangle $OPK$ has base $1$ and height , $\\frac{x_a}{y_a}$ , so its area is given by . $\\frac{x_a}{2y_a}$    Hence, the area of region $OPJA$ is given by $\\frac{x_a}{2y_a} - \\frac{(1-y_a)^2}{2y_a}$      Here, we need to integrate over the upper right half of the unit square, which is given by:     $P_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{y}\\int_{1-y}^{1} x - (1-y)^2 dx dy$    Here notice that we have changed the order of integration from the previous region for the same reason that we need to integrate first with respect to whichever variable will not yield a logarithm.     $= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{y} \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2} - (1-y)^2 x\\right]_{1-y}^{1} dy$     $= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{y} \\left[\\frac{1}{2} - (1-y)^2 - \\frac{(1-y)^2}{2} + (1-y)^3\\right] dy$     $= \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{1}3y - 2y^2 dy$     $= \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac{3y^2}{2} - \\frac{2y^3}{3}\\right]_0^1$     $= \\frac{5}{24}$      Thus, the probability is given by $P_1 + P_2 = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}$",

        "solution": "Any cube which was a part of the \"interior\" cube of side $n - 2$ is not affected by the paint remover, so it will always have $5$ faces painted.    For a cube to have paint removed from exactly one unpainted face, one of two things must happen. Either it is on an edge of the larger cube where exactly one exposed face is unpainted, or it is on the face of the larger cube with a painted face exposed.    There are $6(n - 2)^2$ face-cubes. The probability that they have a painted face exposed is , $5/6$ , so the expected number of face-cubes with exactly four faces painted white is . $5(n - 2)^2$    There are $12(n - 2)$ edge-cubes. The chance that their unpainted face is one of the two exposed is , $2/6 = 1/3$ , so we can expect $4(n - 2)$ cubes to be painted on exactly four sides.    Combining cases, we get $5(n - 2)^2 + 4(n - 2)$",

Let . $k = \\sigma(1)$ Notice that , $\\sigma(x + 1) \\equiv \\sigma(x) + \\sigma(1) \\equiv  \\sigma(x) + k \\pmod{100}$ , and by extension, . $\\sigma(x) \\equiv kx \\pmod{100}$ Since we need $\\sigma$ to be a bijection, we must have . $\\gcd(k, 100) = 1$  $\\blacksquare$     Claim 2: Claim 2:  . $f(1) = 2000$     Proof. Proof.  $f(1)$ is simply the sum of all possible . $k$ Notice that $\\gcd(k, 100) = 1$ iff $\\gcd(k, 2) = 1$ and . $\\gcd(k, 5) = 1$ We find the sum of all multiples of 2 or 5 less than or equal to 100 like so:     \\begin{align*} s = & (2 + 4 + \\dots + 100) + (5 + 10 + \\dots + 100) - (10 + 20 + \\dots + 100) \\\\ = & 2 \\cdot 1275 + 5 \\cdot 210 - 10 \\cdot 55 = 3050 \\end{align*}  And so . $f(1) = (1 + 2 + \\dots + 100) - s = 5050 - 3050 = 2000$  $\\blacksquare$     Claim 3: Claim 3:  $f(l) = f(1) = 2000$ for any $l$ coprime to 100.     Proof. Proof. Notice that, for any $l$ coprime to 100, $\\sigma(l) \\equiv kl \\pmod{100}$ must be coprime to 100 as well. Let us say $k_1l \\equiv k_2l \\pmod{100}$ for some $k_1, k_2$ coprime to and less than 100. Then, we have ; $(k_1 - k_2)l \\equiv 0 \\pmod{100}$ ;  $l \\equiv 0 \\pmod{100}$ is impossible, so we must have . $k_1 - k_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{100} \\implies k_1 = k_2$ Therefore, $\\sigma(l)$ is distinct for each , $k$ , and since $\\sigma(l)$ must be coprime to 100 as well, the possible values for $\\sigma(l)$ are simply the possible values for , $k$ , i.e. . $f(l) = f(1) = 2000$  $\\blacksquare$     Claim 4: Claim 4:  $f(n) \\le 2000$ for any . $n$     Proof. Proof. We have already proven this for $n$ coprime to 100, so we will assume . $\\gcd(n, 100) \\ne 1$ Let . $m = \\gcd(n, 100)$ Then we have $n = mn'$ where . $\\gcd(n', 100) = 1$ Let . $g = \\frac{100}{m}$ Let us consider all $x \\le g$ such that $x$ is coprime to 100. If we let $x' = x + yg$ for any integer , $0 \\le y \\le m - 1$ , we know $x'$ is coprime to 100 as well, and . $nx \\equiv mn'x \\equiv mn'(x + yg) \\equiv mn'x' \\pmod{100}$ Therefore, if two different values of $\\sigma(1)$ are congruent mod , $g$ , then $\\sigma(n)$ in each case will be equal, so we need only consider . $\\sigma(1) \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, g\\}$ Finally, we have     \\begin{align*} f(n) &= \\sum_{i = 1,\\ \\gcd(i, 100) = 1}^g (i \\cdot n\\bmod{100}) \\le \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i = 1,\\ \\gcd(i, 100) = 1}^{100} (i \\cdot m \\cdot n' \\bmod{100}) \\\\ &\\le \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot m \\sum_{i = 1,\\ \\gcd(i, 100) = 1}^{100} (i \\cdot n' \\bmod{100}) = \\sum_{i = 1,\\ \\gcd(i, 100) = 1}^{100} (i \\cdot n' \\bmod{100}) = 2000 \\end{align*}  because $n'$ is coprime to 100. $\\blacksquare$     Claim 5: Claim 5:  $f(n) \\ge 50$ for any . $n$    First we verify that this is achievable. We know that $k = \\sigma(1)$ must be odd, so $\\sigma(50) = 50\\sigma(1) \\bmod 100 = 50(2l + 1) \\bmod 100 = 50$ for any possible value of , $k$ , and so . $f(50) = 50$    Next, we show that this is optimal. Say there exists some $n$ such that $\\sigma(n)$ can be $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\dots$ such that . $\\sum_i p_i < 50$ Clearly, $p_i < 50$ as well. If we define , $m$ ,  , $g$ , and $y$ as before, we have that $p_i + yg \\bmod 100$ must also be a valid . $p$ We have either $g = 100$ or . $g \\mid 50$ The first case is only possible when $n$ is coprime to 100 and we have shown $f(n) = 2000$ in this case so we do not need to consider it. In the second case, there exists some integer $y$ such that , $yg = 50$ , and we can simply take some $p$ and add $yg$ to get another $p$ greater than 50, contradiction. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(n)$ is 50. $\\blacksquare$    The answer is $2000 - 50 = \\fbox{1950}$ (this solution is probably unnecessarily long). $\\square$",

WLOG, say $n_{j + 1} \\ge n_j$ (statement 1).    First, let us find sequences for . $i = 1$ The only such sequence is , $\\frac{1}{1}$ , so we need $p_1 = 1$ and $a_1 > 1$ or $p_1 - 1 = 1 \\implies p_1 = 2$ and . $a_1 = 1$ The first case is invalid because 1 isn't a prime, but the second case is valid, so $m = 2$ is a possible solution.    Let us assume $\\frac{1}{2}$ isn't in a sequence with . $i > 1$ Then, the maximum value for the sum is $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$ (as 3 is the next prime after 2, and there can only be up to 3 primes if 2 isn't a factor). Clearly, this sequence is invalid because we may have $p_1 = 3$ and , $p_2 - 1 = 3$ , but we can't find a value for $p_3$ without repeating a prime. Any other sequence following statement 1 and not including $\\frac{1}{2}$ must have a sum less than 1. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2}$ must be in the sequence, i.e. . $n_1 = 2$    For : $i = 2$ : The only such sequence is . $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}$ We have , $p_1 = 2$ ,  , $a_1 > 1$ ,  , $p_2 - 1 = 2 \\implies p_2 = 3$ ,  . $a_2 = 1$ Therefore we have , $m = 2^k \\cdot 3$ ,  , $k > 1$ , which is the same as , $m = 2^{k'} \\cdot 12$ ,  . $k' \\ge 0$ We see that $m = 2^{k'} \\cdot 12 < 300$ implies , $2^{k'} < 25$ , so . $k' \\le 4$ Finding the sum of all $m$ of this form, we find . $12(2^0 + 2^1 + \\dots + 2^4) = 372$    For : $i = 3$ : The only such sequences are $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$ and . $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6}$ The first sequence is invalid because it requires some , $p_i = 4$ , but 4 isn't prime. The second sequence works, and it implies . $p_1 = 2, a_1 > 1, p_2 = 3, a_2 > 1, p_3 = 7, a_3 = 1$ If we take the minimum possible $m$ of this form, we get . $m = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 = 252$ Multiplying by 2 or 3 would exceed the bound of 300, so 252 is the only solution of this form.    For : $i = 4$ : Notice that , $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = 1$ , so we must have $n_2 \\le 6$ (otherwise the sum would be less than 1). Clearly $n_2 \\ge 3$ as well (because if $n_2$ were 2 the sum would be greater than 1). Then, we can find all such sequences for each possible value of $n_2$ and see that none of them are valid.    Therefore, the sum of all possible $m$ is . $2 + 372 + 252 = \\fbox{626}$",

In the last expression, the latter sum evaluates to $2^{10} - \\binom{10}{0} = 1023$ by the Binomial Theorem. The best way to evaluate the former sum is to recall that there is an identity that equates sums of this nature to Fibonacci numbers. I forget the exact formulation of this identity often, but testing small values helps:   $$\\binom{0}{0} = 1, \\quad \\binom{1}{0} = 1, \\quad \\binom{2}{0} + \\binom{1}{1} = 2, \\quad \\binom{3}{0} + \\binom{2}{1} = 3, \\quad \\binom{4}{0} + \\binom{3}{1} + \\binom{2}{2} = 5,$$ and so on.

If you do all of this addition and get , $F_{23} = 28657$ , then congratulations, you didn't make an addition mistake! The answer is thus . $28657 - 1024 = \\boxed{27633}$",

Any move sequence along an integer number line that starts and ends at the same point must have an even number of moves, with half of the moves in one direction and half in the other direction.

        "solution": "This problem involves both combinatorics and number theory -- I'll start the discussion with the combinatorics part.    Call a ternary string a - $k$ - repeater repeater if its first (leftmost) - $k$ - digit substring equals its last (rightmost) - $k$ - digit substring. For a ternary string , $d$ , let $f(d)$ denote the smallest positive integer $k$ for which $d$ is a - $k$ - repeater. Call $d$  primitive primitive if $f(d)$ is the length of . $d$    Let $n$ be the length of the string . $d = d_1d_2\\ldots d_n$ We first show that if $d$ is not primitive, then $f(d)$ is necessarily at most . $n/2$ By way of contradiction, if , $2f(d) > n$ , then the leftmost and rightmost substrings of $d$ of length $f(d)$ must overlap in the middle. Specifically, if we let $s$ be the substring $d_1\\ldots d_{f(d)}$ and $t$ be the substring , $d_{n-f(d)+1}\\ldots d_n$ , then $s$ must equal , $t$ , so for each , $i \\in \\{n - f(d) + 1, \\ldots, f(d)\\}$ , we have . $s_i = d_i = t_{i-(n-f(d))} = s_{i-(n-f(d))}$ Therefore, the first $2f(d) - n$ digits of $s$ must match the last $2f(d) - n$ digits of , $s$ , so the first $2f(d) - n$ digits of $d$ must match the last $2f(d) - n$ digits of . $d$ Because $d$ is not primitive, , $f(d) < n$ , so , $2f(d) - n = f(d) + (f(d) - n) < f(d)$ , so $d$ is a - $k$ - repeater for $k$ equal to , $2f(d) - n$ , which is less than ; $f(d)$ ; this contradicts the definition of . $f(d)$    For any $n$ and $k$ with , $1 \\leq k \\leq \\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ , any - $n$ - digit string $d$ with $f(d) = k$ can be uniquely generated by picking a unique primitive - $k$ - digit string , $s$ , picking a unique - $(n-2k)$ - digit string , $t$ , and setting . $d = sts$ The number of ways to choose $s$ is , $a_k$ , and the number of ways to choose $t$ is . $3^{n-2k}$ Thus, there are $3^{n-2k}a_k$ strings $d$ with $n$ digits with . $f(d) = k$ There are $3^n$ total strings $d$ with $n$ digits, so the number of primitive - $n$ - digit strings is   $$a_n = 3^n - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} 3^{n-2k}a_k.$$ Some easy base cases are $a_0 = 1$ and . $a_1 = 3$ We can eliminate the summation from this recurrence relation in several ways. Here are a few:    For , $n \\geq 2$ , observe that   $$a_{n-2} = 3^{n-2} - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor - 1} 3^{n-2-2k}a_k = \\frac{1}{9}\\left(3^n - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor - 1} 3^{n-2k}a_k\\right) = \\frac{a_n + 3^{n-2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} a_{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}}{9},$$ so . $a_n = 9a_{n-2} - 3^{n-2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} a_{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}$ In other words, when $n$ is even, , $a_n = 9a_{n-2} - a_{n/2}$ , and when $n$ is odd, . $a_n = 9a_{n-2} - 3a_{(n-1)/2}$ Also, for odd , $n$ ,  $\\lfloor(n - 1)/2\\rfloor$ equals , $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ , so   $$a_{n-1} = 3^{n-1} - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} 3^{n-1-2k}a_k = \\frac{a_n}{3} \\implies a_n = 3a_{n-1}.$$  The remainder of the problem is number theory. Or maybe someone else can find an explicit formula or a more insightful recurrence relation for . $a_n$",

        "solution": "Bob can do this if $2022$ is replaced for $2n$ for any . $n \\geq 2$ Turn the numbers into a single permutation $a_1,\\ldots,a_{2022}$ of $[2n]$ by reading off the first number on the left, then the first number on the right, then the second number on the left, and so on. Thus $1,2$ on the left and $3,4$ on the right would become $1,3,2,4$ (here ) $n=2$ ) . Then the swapping process corresponds to picking two opposite-parity elements whose positions are also opposite-parity and switching them, so $1,3,2,4 \\to 2,3,1,4$ is illegal but $1,3,2,4 \\to 4,3,2,1$ is legal.    Then it is easy to verify that the number of same-parity inversions—i.e. the number of pairs $i<j$ such that $a_i>a_j$ and — $a_i \\equiv a_j \\pmod{2}$ — has invariant parity: whenever we swap $a_i$ and , $a_j$ , the number of same-parity inversions among $(i,k)$ and $(k,j)$ for $i<k<j$ changes by . $\\pm 1$ Since there are an even number of such $k$ the result follows.    The desired final state has $0$ same-parity inversions. On the other hand, the starting state $3,2,1,4,5,6,7,8,\\ldots$ has $1$ same-parity inversion, so starting with $3,1,5,7,9,\\ldots$ on the left and $2,4,6,8,10,\\ldots$ on the right will make Anna unable to win.",

Then we must have . $a_i=a_{i-1}+a_{i+1}$ Now suppose we delete delete  ; $a_i$ ; I claim the result is - $(n-1)$ - nice. Indeed, , $a_{i+1} \\equiv a_i \\pmod{a_{i-1}}$ , so . $a_{i-1} \\mid a_{i-2}+a_i \\implies a_{i-1} \\mid a_{i-2}+a_{i+1}$ Likewise, . $a_{i+1} \\mid a_{i-1}+a_{i+2}$ Moreover, by the Euclidean algorithm we have   $$1=\\gcd(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i-1}+a_{i+1},a_i,\\ldots,a_n)=\\gcd(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},0,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n)=\\gcd(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n),$$ so the claim is true unless no such $i$ exists. In this case, the - $n$ - tuple is clearly all ' $1$ ' s due to the gcd condition (every element is maximal), in which case the claim still holds, so it's true in general.    I now claim that for , $n \\geq 2$ , the maximal element of an - $n$ - tuple is at most , $F_n$ , and the second-largest element is at most . $F_{n-1}$ This follows by induction: first off, the only good - $1$ - tuple is , $(1)$ , so the only good - $2$ - tuples are $(1,2)$ and $(1,1)$ up to cyclic permutations; thus the claim is true for . $n=2$ Now if the claim is true for , $n$ , it immediately follows that the maximal element of a good - $(n+1)$ - tuple $T$ is at most , $F_{n+1}$ , since it's the sum of two elements of the - $n$ - tuple $T'$ obtained by deleting it. Furthermore, the second-largest element of $T$ is still in , $T'$ , so it's at most . $F_n$    By successively deleting maximal elements and applying the above claim, it follows that the maximum value of $a_1+\\cdots+a_n$ is . $F_1+\\cdots+F_n$ By induction, it is easy to show that this equals , $F_{n+2}-2$ , so we're done. $\\blacksquare$",
