Claim. Claim. (Elimination of non-prime powers) If $n$ is not a prime power, then $n$ is twice a Fermat prime.     Proof. Proof.

        "solution": "If one of $a,b,c$ are squares, the corresponding factor splits into linear factors, at which point it is clear that $P$ is prime-covering. There are $\\tbinom{25}{3}-\\tbinom{20}{3}$ such cases; now assume there are no squares.    Note that every number $\\leq 25$ has at most two distinct prime divisors. Thus we write $a=p^uq^v.$ Then we want to characterize the primes $r$ in which $p^uq^v$ is a QR. Since we dispensed of the square case, there are only two more cases:     Case 1 Case 1 : $u\\equiv 1\\mod 2, v\\equiv 0\\mod 2.$  Then this is equivalent to $p$ being a QR. Call this $a$ type 1.   Case 2 Case 2 : $u\\equiv 1\\mod 2,v\\equiv 1\\mod 2.$  In this case, both $p$ and $q$ are either QRs or NQRs. Call this $a$ type 2.    Now consider the case that one of $a,b,c$ is type 1; WLOG it is $a$ with relevant prime factor $p.$ Then to account for the $p$ NQR case, we need one of $b,c$ to be type 2 with prime $p$ and some other prime $q.$ Then to account for the $q$ QR case, we need the other one of $b,c$ to be type $1$ with relevant prime factor $q$ (it can't be type $2$ with some third prime because that creates counterexamples with Dirichlet).    With similar case analysis, the only case where all of $a,b,c$ are type $2$ is when the relevant primes of $a,b,c$ are $\\{p,q\\},\\{q,r\\},\\{r,p\\}.$    We now compute the answer for each case. We first separate the remaining numbers by type:   \\[1: 2,3,5,7,8,11,12,13,17,18,19,20,23\\] \\[2: 6,10,14,15,21,22,24\\] For the first case, we do casework on the two primes. $p=2$ yields three cases for the type $1,$  $p=3,5$ yields two cases for the type $1,$  $(p,q)=(2,3)$ yields two cases for the type $2,$ and everything else has one case. Adding everything gives $30$ cases.    For the second case, the primes must be $(2,3,5)$ or $(2,3,7).$ This adds another $4$ cases.  We conclude that there are $\\tbinom{25}{3}-\\tbinom{20}{3}+34=1194$ prime-covering polynomials.

Since we are excluding constant factors, we may instead analyze the polynomial $H_p$ defined by $H_p(2x) = 2F_p(x)$ (so ) $H_p(t + \\tfrac{1}{t}) = t^p + \\tfrac{1}{t^p} - 2$ )    Then note that 2 is always a root of , $H_p$ , and   \\[\\frac{H_n(t + t^{-1})}{t + t^{-1} - 2} = \\frac{t^n + t^{-n} - 2}{t + t^{-1} - 2} = \\frac{(t^n - 1)(t^{-n} - 1)}{(t - 1)(t^{-1} - 1)} = (1 + t + \\dots + t^{n - 1})(1 + t^{-1} + \\dots + t^{-(n - 1)}).\\]   If $n \\ge 3$ is odd, we have   \\[\\frac{H_n(t + t^{-1})}{t + t^{-1} - 2} = \\left(t^{-(n - 1)/2} + \\dots + t^{(n - 1)/2}\\right)^2.\\] Hence $\\tfrac{H_n(x)}{x - 2}$ is the square of a polynomial . $P_n$ If $n$ is prime, then $P_n$ is a (scaled) cyclotomic polynomial of order $n$ and is irreducible, so . $g(n) = 3$ If $n$ is composite, then $t^{-(n - 1)/2} + \\dots + t^{(n - 1)/2}$ factors further in , $\\mathbb{Z}[t + t^{-1}]$ , and so . $g(n) \\ge 5$   If $n \\ge 4$ is even,   \\begin{align*} \\frac{H_n(t + t^{-1})}{t + t^{-1} - 2} = (1 + t + \\dots + t^{n - 1})(1 + t^{-1} + \\dots + t^{-(n - 1)}) & = (1 + t)(1 + t^{-1}) (1 + t^2 + \\dots + t^{n - 2}) (1 + t^{-2} + \\dots + t^{-(n - 2)})\\\\ & = (t + t^{-1} + 2) \\left(t^{-(n - 2)/2} + t^{-(n - 4)/2} + \\dots + t^{(n - 2)/2}\\right)^2. \\end{align*} It follows that $H_n(x) = (x - 2)(x + 2)P_n(x)^2$ for some nontrivial polynomial , $P_n$ , so . $g(n) \\ge 4$   We have shown that $g(n) \\ge 3$ when , $n \\ge 3$ , with equality exactly when $n$ is an (odd) prime.

        "text": "Consider an undirected, connected graph $G$ with vertex set . $\\{v_1,v_2,\\ldots, v_6\\}$ Starting at the vertex , $v_1$ , an ant uses a DFS algorithm to traverse through $G$ under the condition that if there are multiple unvisited neighbors of some vertex, the ant chooses the $v_i$ with smallest . $i$ How many possible graphs $G$ are there satisfying the following property: for each , $1\\leq i\\leq 6$ , the vertex $v_i$ is the $i^{\\text{th}}$ new vertex the ant traverses?",
        "solution": "To solve this problem, it is first important to recall what depth-first search (DFS) is.  In a DFS algorithm, the ant will traverse through the vertices of a graph one at a time, travelling as far as possible before backtracking.  This is done subject to the condition that the ant finishes searching a vertex if and only if all of that vertex's neighbors are already visited.  The following example, taken from the 15-210 Parallel and Sequential Algorithms 15-210 Parallel and Sequential Algorithms course textbook, might serve as a good visual aid (although here the DFS is being done on an ordered graph as opposed to an unordered one).  Here, $X$ denotes the set of visited vertices ordered from left to right.         Note that the bolded part of the graph indicating the exact edges traversed in the DFS search forms a tree; this makes sense, since such an algorithm never visits a vertex twice (which in turn would create a cycle).  The key to solving this problem is to focus on this underlying tree (called a DFS tree DFS tree ) and use this to develop a recursion that will help enumerate the number of graphs in question.    Consider any graph $G$ on $n+1$ vertices $\\{v_1,\\ldots, v_{n+1}\\}$ satisfying the property in the question.  Delete the vertex $v_{n+1}$ and all edges incident on it.  Then the resulting graph $G'$ on $n$ vertices $\\{v_1,\\ldots, v_n\\}$ also satisfies the property in question, since the DFS traversal for $G$ must go through the vertices $v_1,\\ldots, v_n$ first before finally reaching . $v_{n+1}$ Now let $P$ denote the unique path connecting vertex $v_1$ to vertex $v_n$ in the DFS tree for . $G'$ The crucial claim is that all of the neighbors of $v_{n+1}$ must be entirely contained in . $P$ Indeed, if this were not the case, then $\\{v_j,v_{n+1}\\}\\in E(G)$ for some . $v_j\\notin P$ Note that by the property in the problem statement, in the DFS tree for , $G'$ ,  $v_j$ is traversed before . $v_n$ But now this means that in the DFS tree for , $G$ , vertex $v_{n+1}$ is traversed before , $v_n$ , since by definition the ant must visit all neighbors of $v_j$ before backtracking onto . $P$ This is a contradiction, and so indeed all neighbors of $v_{n+1}$ must be located on the path . $P$ In turn, one can construct a graph on $n+1$ vertices by first picking a vertex $v$ in $P$ for the ant to travel to $v_{n+1}$ and then selecting any subset of the vertices in the path from $v_1$ to $v$ not containing $v$ in the DFS tree to add as extra neighbors to . $v_{n+1}$ (These will not affect the correctness of the DFS tree due to the given ordering of the vertices, since the vertex $v_{n+1}$ will still be traversed last.)  The picture below demonstrates this. Here the DFS tree is represented in bold; the remaining dashed edges are optional and lead to the $2^k$ term in the recurrence.         The second important step is to recongize that the number of choices for where to place the branching-off point is dependent on the length of . $P$ Thus, for all positive integer pairs $(n,k)$ with , $1\\leq k\\leq n-1$ , let $G_{n,k}$ denote the number of connected graphs on $\\{v_1,\\ldots, v_n\\}$ satisfying the following two properties: The DFS search starting from vertextraversesin this order;In the DFS tree for the graph, the distance between verticesandis.  The DFS search starting from vertextraversesin this order; The DFS search starting from vertex $v_1$ traverses $v_1,v_2,\\ldots, v_n$ in this order;  In the DFS tree for the graph, the distance between verticesandis. In the DFS tree for the graph, the distance between vertices $v_1$ and $v_n$ is . $k$  Additionally, define $G_{n,0} = 0$ for convenience purposes.  Then in order to construct a graph counted in , $G_{n+1,k+1}$ , the vertex $v_{n+1}$ must be attached to the vertex in the path from $v_1$ to $v_n$ which is distance $k$ away from ; $v_1$ ; this can only be done if the length of the path is at least . $k$ Thus, by combining this with the logic above, one establishes the recursion \\[G_{n+1,k+1} = 2^k\\sum_{j=k}^nG_{n,j}.\\] From here, it suffices to compute the $G_{n,k}$ manually.  The computation is a bit intensive when performing the calculations for the $n=6$ case, but it is still doable.   \\[ \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline $G_{n,k}$ & 0 & 1   & 2   & 3   & 4   & 5    \\\\ \\hline 1         & 0 &     &     &     &     &      \\\\ \\hline 2         & 0 & 1   &     &     &     &      \\\\ \\hline 3         & 0 & 1   & 2   &     &     &      \\\\ \\hline 4         & 0 & 3   & 6   & 8   &     &      \\\\ \\hline 5         & 0 & 17  & 34  & 56  & 64  &      \\\\ \\hline 6         & 0 & 171 & 342 & 616 & 960 & 1024 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\] The requested answer is the sum of the entries along the bottom row, which is . $\\boxed{3113}$     Remark: Remark: The sequence of answers for various $n$ - 1, 1, 3, 17, 171, 3113, 106419, ... - is sequence A015083 in the OEIS.

(This can be done by making as many cycles of size $7$ as possible, and then as many cycles of size $5$ as possible, and so on, in which for each step, if there are multiples of $p$ left over that cannot be combined to form a cycle of size $p,$ we shift around the numbers in the already-made cycles of size $p$ such that the left-over multiples of $p$ are ideally divisible by as many primes below $p$ as possible.)

There are $24$ numbers, so it is not difficult to see that the highest possible number of these leftover numbers that can satisfy the desired condition is $4$ if we split these numbers into two cycles of sizes $11$ and $13$ in which the first cycle has $11,22,$ and $66,$ and the second cycle has $13.$ We will be left with $20$ numbers which do not satisfy the desired condition, so the answer is $\\boxed{80}.$  $\\square$",

There are $n$ doors numbered . $1, \\dots, n$ A single gold coin is placed randomly behind one of the doors, with the probability it is placed behind door $i$ equalling $p_i.$ There are $r$ \"rounds\" in which we may make at most $k$ \"turns\" each, defined as follows:    During a \"turn\", you pick two doors and send them to the game host. Then, the host picks one of the two doors in the following manner:   If neither door contains the coin, the host randomly picks one with equal probability.If one of the doors contains the coin, the host picks the door which does not have the coin.  If neither door contains the coin, the host randomly picks one with equal probability. If neither door contains the coin, the host randomly picks one with equal probability.  If one of the doors contains the coin, the host picks the door which does not have the coin. If one of the doors contains the coin, the host picks the door which does not have the coin.  The host reveals that the picked door does not contain the coin, and opens it.    A \"round\" consists of Alice performing at least 1 and at most $k$ turns. After all the  turns in round $j$ are complete, suppose there are $d_j$ doors remaining. Bob will compute the probability of each individual door containing the coin. Let $m_j$ be the minimum of these probabilities computed during the t $j$ t h round. Then, Bob awards Alice $d_jm_j$ points. Note that Bob will pay Alice $r$ times, and Alice's total payout is the sum of the $r$ individual payouts. Note that opened doors remain revealed between rounds.    Suppose $S$ is some strategy that determines which doors Alice sends to the host.  Let $F(S, n,k,r,(p_1, \\dots, p_n))$ be the minimum possible amount Alice could earn with strategy $S$ for parameters , $(n,k,r,(p_1, \\dots, p_n))$ , and let   Find all tuples $(n,k,r,(p_1, \\dots, p_n))$ for which $G(n,k,r,(p_1, \\dots, p_n))=r.$ You may find it useful to consider lists where each element of a list is at most double the prior element.

        "solution": "Context: I got 59 points in contest, doing this problem all by myself, the highest of any team (yes flex) (my greatest accomplishment) (we won TCS overall)    Most proofs are highly unrigorous given the time limit.    Outline of my solution, in contest, including a little bit of my thought process:    Since I knew everyone else would go for the first two problems, I decided to go to this one. For the first 50 minutes, I completely regretted this decision.    At first sight, the problem looks super intimidating. I began by reading the problem. Then reading it again. Then getting distracted and reading it again. After a while (around 20 minutes, probably because I kept getting distracted), I was able to understand the notation. In fact, under the , $G(n,k,r,(p_1,\\dots p_n))$ , I wrote \"num doors, num turns, num rounds, probabilities\" to help me remember the notation better.    Throughout the problems, assume that any provided constructions for probabilities can be permuted, by symmetry.    I began with the first subproblem (3 points): Show that $G(3,1,1,(p_1,p_2,p_3))$ can be less than . $1$ For this, I tested a few probabilities and came to the following lemma:    When opening two doors with probabilities $p$ and , $q$ , the unopened door will get weighted by a factor of . $2$ In other words, the remaining probabilities will be $0, 2p$ or , $0, 2q$ , scaled so that the sum of all the probabilities is still . $1$ This is easy to prove by conditional probability concepts.    This is sufficient to solve this problem, and (iirc) the example I came up with was . $\\left(\\frac12, \\frac13, \\frac16\\right)$    The next subproblem (3 points) was to show that $G(n,n-2,1,(p_1,\\dots p_n))$ can be less than $1$ for all . $n \\geq 3$    For this, I made the following claim.    Claim: It is always optimal to open the doors with the smallest probabilities. The reason for this is because, if we want to maximize , $F$ , then we need all the probabilities to be as close to each other as possible. In my proof, I didn't really account for the case where we might want to make them farther apart temporarily then make them closer later. However, I assumed that this would just be a simple yet annoying edge case check, so I didn't mention it.    At this point, I realized that the problem would be simplest if, after combining two doors, the sum of the probabilities remained the same. This would imply that the doors combined must have the same probability. This gave me the idea for the following solution:    We can simply take the probabilities , $\\left(\\frac 12, \\frac 13, \\frac 16, \\frac 1{12}, \\dots \\frac{1}{6\\cdot 2^{n-2}}, \\frac{1}{6\\cdot 2^{n-2}}\\right)$ , and combining the smallest two probabilities will collapse into a case with , $n \\mapsto n-1$ , since the sum of all the probabilities remains the same.    The next subproblem (3 points) was to show that $G(3,1,1,(p_1,p_2,p_3))$ can be . $1$ This is easy to do with . $\\left(\\frac12,\\frac14,\\frac14\\right)$    The next subproblem (10 points) is to show that there exists a tuple $(n,k,1,(p_1,\\dots p_n))$ with $n>2024, k>506$ such that for all increasing $k'$ from $1$ to $k$ increases $G(n,k',1,(p_1,\\dots p_n))$ and the value is $1$ when . $k'=k$    For this, I simply noted that when the probabilities are $\\left(\\frac12, \\frac14, \\dots \\frac1{2^{n-1}}, \\frac1{2^{n-1}}\\right)$ and there are no more turns, then the final score is . $\\frac{n}{2^{n-1}}$ Since each turn decreases , $n$ , we can simply take this set of probabilities for sufficiently large . $n > k > 2025$ This is because the probability increases as $n$ increases until we reach . $n=2$    At this point, I tried to get some of my team members to help me, to no avail. Three of them were working on the problem one construction, two on the bound, and two more were working on problem 2.    The next subproblem (6 points): Determine when . $G(4,k,r,(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)) = r$    I immediately thought to do casework on : $r$ : we are given that . $rk+1 < n$ Therefore, we check when , $r=2$ , so . $k=1$ Then, we require that after $1$ turn, the probabilities are all equal, and after another turn, the probabilities are once again all equal. However, in one turn, the probabilities $\\left(\\frac13, \\frac13, \\frac13\\right)$ can only be turned into . $\\left(\\frac13, \\frac23\\right)$    Therefore, we must instead have . $r=1$ The set of probabilities which can be reduced to $\\left(\\frac13, \\frac13, \\frac13\\right)$ in exactly one move consists only of . $\\left(\\frac13, \\frac13, \\frac16, \\frac16\\right)$ Note that in this case, $k$ can be either $1$ or $2$ To reduce to $\\left(\\frac12, \\frac12\\right)$ in exactly two moves, we must have $\\left(\\frac12, \\frac14, \\frac18, \\frac18\\right)$ and . $k=2$    Now, we continue to the problem of showing when . $G(n,k,r,(p_1,\\dots p_n)) = r$ The points are as follows:    5 points for $k=1$  10 points for $k=2, r=1$  20 points for $r=1$ with exactly $k$ turns per round  35 points for $r=1$  55 points for $r=1,2$  75 points for a full solution    When I saw these scoring guidelines, I only had around 15 minutes left. I first tried , $k=1$ , thinking that the lack of a restriction on $r$ is strange. Of course, it turns out this case is trivial: I quickly realized $r$ must be $1$ simply because you cannot go from one position of all equal probabilities to another position of all equal probabilities in one turn.    I then decided to try . $r=1$ My conjecture for this, based on previous problems, is simply to modify the power of $2$ strategy from the $n=4$ case. However, I did not really provide a specific proof for this. Specifically, we could have some amount of equal probabilities, then use the dividing by $2$ strategy constantly.    I here quickly realized that the 20 point case is isomorphic to the 35 point case, because we can simply just take all the values of $k$ bigger than the exact number of turns necessary.    Anyways, it took me 10 very unfortunate minutes to actually calculate the annoying values and indices. Eventually, the probabilities which can be collapsed into an all equal case in exactly $k$ turns is     \\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{n-k+1}, \\frac{1}{n-k+1}, \\dots \\frac{1}{n-k+1}, \\frac{1}{(n-k+1)2}, \\frac{1}{(n-k+1)2^2}, \\dots \\frac{1}{(n-k+1)2^{k}}, \\frac{1}{(n-k+1)2^{k}} \\right) \\] where $\\frac{1}{n-k+1}$ occurs $n-k$ times. Then, for the 35 point case, we can simply take anything larger than this $k$ as the new $k$ value to produce a valid tuple.    Once I did this, I had around 5 minutes left, but instead of trying to prove my unproven lemmas, I wondered how it would be possible to go from one set of equal probabilities to another, smaller set, thereby giving an $r=2$ solution. I came to the conclusion that the only way this is possible is if the $n-k+1$ in the previous problem is even, and we can combine pairs to form another equal configuration. I was definitely unable to support this conclusion with any proof, but nonetheless I wrote up my thoughts. Clearly, if this is true, the general solution is much the same as . $r=2$    We start with a configuration such as the tuple mentioned above, and it suffices that $2^r$ divides . $n-k+1$ However, in the contest, I only had time to writeup my ideas for extending to . $r=2$ I said that $n-k+1$ would have to be even, and we could combine in pairs, and with no time remaining added that \"It is easy to extend this idea to larger \" $r$ \"    If I ever decide to prove many of these claims rigorously, I will definitely return...",

First, pick two students who are not yet in line.  Do not pick the two shortest students not yet in line.Put the shorter of the two students in the next spot in line, then put in the taller student.Take the shortest student still not in line and place them next.Repeat this process until all students have been placed in line.

Do not pick the two shortest students not yet in line.  Put the shorter of the two students in the next spot in line, then put in the taller student. Put the shorter of the two students in the next spot in line, then put in the taller student.  Take the shortest student still not in line and place them next. Take the shortest student still not in line and place them next.  Repeat this process until all students have been placed in line. Repeat this process until all students have been placed in line.  For example, we could pick students $1$ and $3$ to be the line, and then student $2$ will join the line next.  (For our purposes, student $i$ is taller than student $j$ if and only if . $i > j$ )  Then, we could pick students $10$ and , $12$ , and then student $4$ would join.  Then, we could pick $6$ and , $9$ , and then . $5$ Last, we pick $8$ and , $11$ , making $7$ join last.  After each iteration, the line looks like this:   $$1,3,2 \\qquad [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]$$ $$1,3,2,10,12,4 \\qquad [5,6,7,8,9,11]$$ $$1,3,2,10,12,4,6,9,5 \\qquad [7,8,11]$$ $$1,3,2,10,12,4,6,9,5,8,11,7 \\quad\\, [\\ ]$$  We show that this construction counts each valid line exactly once, and counts each invalid line zero times.  First of all, making a different choice at one iteration results in different lines, so no line is counted more than once.  This line is also incapable of making invalid lines: both conditions must be satisfied based on the nature of the construction.  Finally, any given valid line can be constructed, the reason for which we will motivate by an example:    Suppose the given valid line starts off as . $1,2,3$ This is not allowed because the third person has to be shorter than the second person.  This fact allows us to complete the first step.  Now suppose the given line starts with students $6$ and $9$ (this is allowed).  In a valid line, they must be in the order , $6,9$ , in order to follow the pattern, so we can complete the second step.  Next, student $1$ (the shortest student not yet in line) cannot go anywhere other than right after : $9$ : putting them later would violate the pattern and/or condition two.  Therefore the given line must include $1$ as coming next, so we can complete the third step.  Finally, all of the remaining students are taller than the third student in line, so the rest of the given line is not affected by the first three students.  This allows us to loop back on our method until all students have been placed.    The total number of valid lines is then equal to the total number of constructions.  There are $\\binom{n}{2} - 1$ choices at each iteration, if there are $n$ people left to place in the line.  Thus the total number of lines is $$\\left(\\binom{12}{2} - 1 \\right) \\left(\\binom{9}{2} - 1 \\right) \\left(\\binom{6}{2} - 1 \\right) \\left(\\binom{3}{2} - 1 \\right) = 65 \\times 35 \\times 14 \\times 2 = \\boxed{63700}.$$",

        "text": "Daniel has a (mostly) standard deck of 54 cards, consisting of 4 suits each containing the ranks 1 to 13 as well as 2 jokers. Daniel plays the following game: He shuffles the deck uniformly randomly and then takes all of the cards that end up strictly between the two jokers. He then sums up the ranks of all the cards he has taken and calls that his score.    Let $p$ be the probability that his score is a multiple of 13. There exists relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b,$ with $b$ as small as possible, such that $|p - a/b| < 10^{-10}.$ What is $a/b?$     Proposed by Dilhan Salgado, Daniel Li Proposed by Dilhan Salgado, Daniel Li",
        "solution": "The key is to build a generating function with two formal variables: . $x$ whose exponent represents the number of cards strictly between the two jokers, and . $y$ whose exponent represents the sum of the ranks of the cards strictly between the jokers.    To begin, note that if there are $a_1$  ' $1$ ' s, $a_2$  ' $2$ ' s, ..., $a_{13}$  ' $13$ ' s between the two jokers and , $S := a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{13}$ , then there are   $\\frac{S!}{a_1! a_2! \\dots a_{13}!}$ ways to arrange the cards between the jokers, and $\\frac{(53-S)!}{(4-a_1)! (4-a_2)! \\dots (4-a_{13})!}$ ways to arrange the rest of the cards, since we may consider all cards between the jokers inclusive as one big card (to make $53-S$ total cards with $4-a_1$  ' $1$ ' s, $4-a_2$  ' $2$ ' s, and so on). Furthermore, there are a total of $\\frac{54!}{4!^{13} \\cdot 2}$ ways to arrange the cards. Hence if   \\[ f(x, y) = \\frac{4!^{13} \\cdot 2}{54!} \\sum_{0 \\le a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{13} \\le 4} \\frac{S!}{a_1! a_2! \\dots a_{13}!} \\cdot \\frac{(53-S)!}{(4-a_1)! (4-a_2)! \\dots (4-a_{13})!} x^S y^{a_1 + 2a_2 + \\dots +13a_{13}},\\] then the answer is the sum of the coefficients of the terms with exponent of $y$ divisible by $13$ (the exponent of $x$ doesn't matter). We can rewrite this as   \\begin{align*}    f(x, y) &= \\frac{4!^{13} \\cdot 2}{54!} \\sum_{0 \\le a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{13} \\le 4} \\frac{53!}{\\binom{53}S} \\cdot \\frac1{4!^{13}} \\binom{4}{a_1} \\binom{4}{a_2} \\dots \\binom{4}{a_{13}}  x^S y^{a_1 + 2a_2 + \\dots +13a_{13}}, \\\\ &= \\frac1{27} \\sum_{0 \\le a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{13} \\le 4} \\frac{x^S}{\\binom{53}S} \\binom{4}{a_1} \\left(y^1 \\right)^{a_1} \\cdot \\binom{4}{a_2} \\left(y^2 \\right)^{a_2} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\binom{4}{a_{13}} \\left(y^{13} \\right)^{a_{13}}. \\end{align*} Thus if   \\[g(x, y) := \\frac1{27} \\left( \\sum_{a_1=0}^4 x \\binom{4}{a_1} y^1 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{a_2=0}^4 x \\binom{4}{a_2} y^2 \\right) \\dots \\left( \\sum_{a_{13}=0}^4 x \\binom{4}{a_{13}} y^{13} \\right) =  \\frac1{27}(1+xy)^4 (1+xy^2)^4 \\dots (1+xy^{13})^4\\] then $g$ has the same terms as $f$ except with each power of $x$ of the form $x^S$ having a coefficient $\\binom{53}{S}$ times larger. Now, treating $g$ like a polynomial in $y$ alone, we can compute the sum of the coefficients of the terms with an exponent of $y$ divisible by $13$ to obtain a polynomial in , $x$ , then change each term of the form $x^S$ to $\\frac1{\\binom{53}{S}}$ to obtain our answer. This is pretty easy with the root of unity filter: let . $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 13}$ Then the desired polynomial in $x$ is   \\[ h(x) := \\frac{g(x, 1) + g(x, \\omega) + \\dots + g(x, \\omega^{12})}{13} \\] For any primitive t $13$ t h root of unity , $\\zeta$ ,  $1, \\zeta^2, \\dots, \\zeta^{12}$ covers all possible roots of unity, so   \\begin{align*}    g(x, \\zeta) &= \\frac1{27} ((1+x\\zeta) (1+x\\zeta^2) \\dots (1+x\\zeta^{13}))^4 \\\\   &= \\frac1{27} \\left( -x^{13} \\left(-\\frac1x - \\zeta\\right) \\left(-\\frac1x - \\zeta^2\\right) \\dots \\left(-\\frac1x - \\zeta^{13}\\right) \\right)^4 \\\\   &= \\frac1{27} \\left( -x^{13} \\left(\\left(-\\frac1x\\right)^{13} - 1\\right) \\right)^4 \\\\   &= \\frac1{27} (x^{13} + 1)^4. \\end{align*} But $13$ is prime, so all such $\\omega^k$ with $0<k<13$ are primitive, hence   \\[ h(x) = \\frac{g(x, 1) + 12 g(x, \\omega)}{13} = \\frac1{13} \\left(\\frac{(1+x)^{52}}{27} + 12 \\cdot \\frac{(x^{13} + 1)^4}{27} \\right).\\] Now it suffices to change each $x^S$ to $\\frac1{\\binom{53}{S}}$ and sum the resulting expression.    For the first term, each monomial is of the form , $\\frac1{13 \\cdot 27} \\binom{52}{S} x^S$ , hence each monomial contributes   \\[ \\frac1{13 \\cdot 27} \\cdot \\frac{\\binom{52}{S}}{\\binom{53}{S}} = \\frac1{13 \\cdot 27} \\cdot \\frac{52! \\cdot S! \\cdot (53 - S)!}{53! \\cdot S! \\cdot (52 - S)!} = \\frac{53 - S}{13 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 53}.\\] Summing from $S = 0$ to , $52$ , this contributes a total of . $\\frac1{13 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 53} \\cdot \\frac{53 \\cdot 54}{2} = \\frac1{13}$    Now for the second term, we can expand normally to find that the expression is   \\[ \\frac{12}{13 \\cdot 27} \\left( 1 + 4x^{13} + 6x^{26} + 4x^{39} + x^{52} \\right).\\] Ignoring the constant at the front, the first and the last monomial give $1$ and , $\\frac1{53}$ , respectively, while the middle three contribute less than $\\frac{9}{\\binom{53}{12}} \\ll 10^{-9}$ (not enough), hence the answer is   \\[ \\frac1{13} + \\frac{12}{13 \\cdot 27} \\left(1 + \\frac1{53} \\right) = \\frac1{13} + \\frac{12}{13 \\cdot 27} \\cdot \\frac{54}{53} = \\frac{53 + 24}{689} = \\frac{77}{689}. \\]",

For instance, if there are currently two hearts on the top of the pile (and the third card in the pile is not hearts), then placing a heart would be worth 2 points, and placing a card of any other suit would be worth 0 points. What is the expected number of points Adam will have after placing all 52 cards?     Proposed by Adam Bertelli Proposed by Adam Bertelli",
        "solution": "really fun problem to solve    Number the cards as follows for convenience: . $\\{A1, A2, \\ldots, A13\\}, \\{B1, B2, \\ldots, B13\\}, \\{C1, C2, \\ldots, C13\\}, \\{D1, D2, \\ldots, D13\\}$ The letter corresponds to the suit of the card. Suppose we place each card in a row, where cards to the left are placed earlier (ie, the leftmost card is the first card placed down). This is obviously equivalent to the original problem.    Now, here's the cool part: Assume we have the following \"placement\" of cards (this is just an example): $$B1, A1, A2, A3, A4, \\ldots$$ The score of card $A2$ is obviously , $1$ , the score of card $A3$ is , $2$ , and the score of card $A4$ is $3$ (this comes from the given scoring system). However, we can also interpret the score of an individual card as the number of \"runs\" of same-suit cards (of any length) that a particular card \"ends\". For example, the card $A4$ \"ends\" exactly $3$ runs - the run , $A3, A4$ , the run , $A2, A3, A4$ , and the run . $A1, A2, A3, A4$ This is obviously true for any arbitrary card.    Using this new definition, we see that the final score is simply the number of runs (of any length) in the entire row. This is now quite easy to count via casework and linearity of expectation.    We wish to find the expected number of runs of length $n$ in the entire row ( ( $n$ will obviously range from $2$ to $13$ in our final answer). There are $53-n$ possible \"locations\" where the run could be. At each one of these locations, there is a $\\frac {12}{51}\\cdot \\frac{11}{50}\\cdots \\frac{14-n}{53-n}$ probability of a run of length $n$ occuring. Thus, the expected number of runs of length $n$ in the entire row is just $$\\left(\\frac {12}{51}\\cdot \\frac{11}{50}\\cdots \\frac{14-n}{53-n}\\right)\\cdot (53-n)$$ by linearity. The expression is equal to $$\\cfrac{\\cfrac{12!}{(13-n)!}}{\\cfrac{51!}{(52-n)!}}\\cdot (53-n) = \\frac{12!(52-n)!\\cdot (53-n)}{51!(13-n)!} = \\frac{12!(53-n)!}{51!(13-n)!}.$$ Summing over all possible \"run-lengths\", we see that the expected score that we will get is $$\\sum^{13}_{n = 2} \\frac{12!(53-n)!}{51!(13-n)!} = \\sum^{13}_{n = 2} \\frac{12!40!(53-n)!}{51!40!(13-n)!} = \\sum^{13}_{n = 2} \\frac{12!40!}{51!}\\cdot {{53-n}\\choose 40}=\\frac{12!40!}{51!}\\sum^{13}_{n= 2}{53-n\\choose 40}.$$ Finally, we can apply the Hockey Stick identity to get that $$\\sum^{13}_{n= 2}{53-n\\choose 40} = {52\\choose 41}$$ , so the final answer is $$\\frac{12!40!}{51!}\\cdot {52\\choose 41} = \\boxed{\\frac{624}{41}}$$ $\\blacksquare$",

Mark a dot at points $(i,a_i)$ for each . $1\\le i \\le 16$ If , $a_{16}<16$ , draw a vertical line from $(16,a_{16})$ to . $(16,16)$ So we have an up-and-right lattice path from $(0,0)$ to . $(16,16)$ The height of column $i$ under this path is , $a_i$ , so the sum of $a_i$ is the area under the path.

        "solution": "Intuitively, we see that the smallest desired $N$ is the smallest $N$ that guarantees that the desired result holds true minus a little bit, because the difference between consecutive squares getting smaller and smaller makes it harder and harder to find $101$ consecutive intervals, none of which is in between two multiples of $1001.$ (Alternatively, we can note that $N=101, 201, 302, 404,$ and $k-1,$ where $k$ is the answer we will find, all make the interval $[N^2, (N+1)^2)$ not have a multiple of $1001$ in it.)    The $N$ that guarantees the desired result is $N=500$ because for $N \\ge 500,$ the interval $[N^2, (N+1)^2)$ has $\\ge 1001$ numbers in it. Now, looking at the residues of $500^2, 499^2, 498^2, \\ldots$ modulo $1001,$ we see that it goes $751, 753, 757, \\ldots,$ with the difference increasing by $2$ each time. The moment this residue passes from just below $1001$ to just above it (i.e. just above ) $0$ ) , the difference between $N^2$ and $(N+1)^2$ will be small enough to make the interval $[N^2, (N+1)^2)$ not have a multiple of $1001.$ Therefore, we want to stop just before then.

        "solution": "There are $2$ ways to choose which person hits $10$ while Zack is still at $0$ (both other players can do so but we will correct for overcount later), call them Player $A.$ Then, we can view the problem as arranging $21$  ' $X$ ' s and $10$  ' $Y$ ' s if we use an $X$ to represent a win by Zack or Player $A$ (the first $10$  ' $X$ ' s represent a win by Player $A$ and the next $11$  ' $X$ ' s represent a win by Zack) and if we use a $Y$ to represent a win by the third player (if some ' $Y$ ' s come after the last $X,$ then we can scrap those but having $10$  ' $Y$ ' s makes sure that the third player doesn't win before Zack does). Thus, our count is now $$2 \\cdot \\binom{31}{10}.$$ However, the situation in which both other players reach $10$ while Zack is still at $0$ is counted twice, so our final answer is $$\\boxed{2\\binom{31}{10}-\\binom{20}{10}}.$$ $\\square$",

First, pick two students who are not yet in line.  Do not pick the two shortest students not yet in line.Put the shorter of the two students in the next spot in line, then put in the taller student.Take the shortest student still not in line and place them next.Repeat this process until all students have been placed in line.  First, pick two students who are not yet in line.  Do not pick the two shortest students not yet in line. First, pick two students who are not yet in line.  Do not pick the two shortest students not yet in line.  Put the shorter of the two students in the next spot in line, then put in the taller student. Put the shorter of the two students in the next spot in line, then put in the taller student.  Take the shortest student still not in line and place them next. Take the shortest student still not in line and place them next.  Repeat this process until all students have been placed in line. Repeat this process until all students have been placed in line.  For example, we could pick students $1$ and $3$ to be the line, and then student $2$ will join the line next.  (For our purposes, student $i$ is taller than student $j$ if and only if . $i > j$ )  Then, we could pick students $10$ and , $12$ , and then student $4$ would join.  Then, we could pick $6$ and , $9$ , and then . $5$ Last, we pick $8$ and , $11$ , making $7$ join last.  After each iteration, the line looks like this:   $$1,3,2 \\qquad [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]$$ $$1,3,2,10,12,4 \\qquad [5,6,7,8,9,11]$$ $$1,3,2,10,12,4,6,9,5 \\qquad [7,8,11]$$ $$1,3,2,10,12,4,6,9,5,8,11,7 \\quad\\, [\\ ]$$  We show that this construction counts each valid line exactly once, and counts each invalid line zero times.  First of all, making a different choice at one iteration results in different lines, so no line is counted more than once.  This line is also incapable of making invalid lines: both conditions must be satisfied based on the nature of the construction.  Finally, any given valid line can be constructed, the reason for which we will motivate by an example:    Suppose the given valid line starts off as . $1,2,3$ This is not allowed because the third person has to be shorter than the second person.  This fact allows us to complete the first step.  Now suppose the given line starts with students $6$ and $9$ (this is allowed).  In a valid line, they must be in the order , $6,9$ , in order to follow the pattern, so we can complete the second step.  Next, student $1$ (the shortest student not yet in line) cannot go anywhere other than right after : $9$ : putting them later would violate the pattern and/or condition two.  Therefore the given line must include $1$ as coming next, so we can complete the third step.  Finally, all of the remaining students are taller than the third student in line, so the rest of the given line is not affected by the first three students.  This allows us to loop back on our method until all students have been placed.    The total number of valid lines is then equal to the total number of constructions.  There are $\\binom{n}{2} - 1$ choices at each iteration, if there are $n$ people left to place in the line.  Thus the total number of lines is $$\\left(\\binom{12}{2} - 1 \\right) \\left(\\binom{9}{2} - 1 \\right) \\left(\\binom{6}{2} - 1 \\right) \\left(\\binom{3}{2} - 1 \\right) = 65 \\times 35 \\times 14 \\times 2 = \\boxed{63700}.$$",

        "text": "Daniel has a (mostly) standard deck of 54 cards, consisting of 4 suits each containing the ranks 1 to 13 as well as 2 jokers. Daniel plays the following game: He shuffles the deck uniformly randomly and then takes all of the cards that end up strictly between the two jokers. He then sums up the ranks of all the cards he has taken and calls that his score.    Let $p$ be the probability that his score is a multiple of 13. There exists relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $b,$ with $b$ as small as possible, such that $|p - a/b| < 10^{-10}.$ What is $a/b?$     Proposed by Dilhan Salgado, Daniel Li Proposed by Dilhan Salgado, Daniel Li",
        "solution": "The key is to build a generating function with two formal variables: . $x$ whose exponent represents the number of cards strictly between the two jokers, and . $y$ whose exponent represents the sum of the ranks of the cards strictly between the jokers.    To begin, note that if there are $a_1$  ' $1$ ' s, $a_2$  ' $2$ ' s, ..., $a_{13}$  ' $13$ ' s between the two jokers and , $S := a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{13}$ , then there are   $\\frac{S!}{a_1! a_2! \\dots a_{13}!}$ ways to arrange the cards between the jokers, and $\\frac{(53-S)!}{(4-a_1)! (4-a_2)! \\dots (4-a_{13})!}$ ways to arrange the rest of the cards, since we may consider all cards between the jokers inclusive as one big card (to make $53-S$ total cards with $4-a_1$  ' $1$ ' s, $4-a_2$  ' $2$ ' s, and so on). Furthermore, there are a total of $\\frac{54!}{4!^{13} \\cdot 2}$ ways to arrange the cards. Hence if   \\[ f(x, y) = \\frac{4!^{13} \\cdot 2}{54!} \\sum_{0 \\le a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{13} \\le 4} \\frac{S!}{a_1! a_2! \\dots a_{13}!} \\cdot \\frac{(53-S)!}{(4-a_1)! (4-a_2)! \\dots (4-a_{13})!} x^S y^{a_1 + 2a_2 + \\dots +13a_{13}},\\] then the answer is the sum of the coefficients of the terms with exponent of $y$ divisible by $13$ (the exponent of $x$ doesn't matter). We can rewrite this as   \\begin{align*}    f(x, y) &= \\frac{4!^{13} \\cdot 2}{54!} \\sum_{0 \\le a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{13} \\le 4} \\frac{53!}{\\binom{53}S} \\cdot \\frac1{4!^{13}} \\binom{4}{a_1} \\binom{4}{a_2} \\dots \\binom{4}{a_{13}}  x^S y^{a_1 + 2a_2 + \\dots +13a_{13}}, \\\\ &= \\frac1{27} \\sum_{0 \\le a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{13} \\le 4} \\frac{x^S}{\\binom{53}S} \\binom{4}{a_1} \\left(y^1 \\right)^{a_1} \\cdot \\binom{4}{a_2} \\left(y^2 \\right)^{a_2} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\binom{4}{a_{13}} \\left(y^{13} \\right)^{a_{13}}. \\end{align*} Thus if   \\[g(x, y) := \\frac1{27} \\left( \\sum_{a_1=0}^4 x \\binom{4}{a_1} y^1 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{a_2=0}^4 x \\binom{4}{a_2} y^2 \\right) \\dots \\left( \\sum_{a_{13}=0}^4 x \\binom{4}{a_{13}} y^{13} \\right) =  \\frac1{27}(1+xy)^4 (1+xy^2)^4 \\dots (1+xy^{13})^4\\] then $g$ has the same terms as $f$ except with each power of $x$ of the form $x^S$ having a coefficient $\\binom{53}{S}$ times larger. Now, treating $g$ like a polynomial in $y$ alone, we can compute the sum of the coefficients of the terms with an exponent of $y$ divisible by $13$ to obtain a polynomial in , $x$ , then change each term of the form $x^S$ to $\\frac1{\\binom{53}{S}}$ to obtain our answer. This is pretty easy with the root of unity filter: let . $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 13}$ Then the desired polynomial in $x$ is   \\[ h(x) := \\frac{g(x, 1) + g(x, \\omega) + \\dots + g(x, \\omega^{12})}{13} \\] For any primitive t $13$ t h root of unity , $\\zeta$ ,  $1, \\zeta^2, \\dots, \\zeta^{12}$ covers all possible roots of unity, so   \\begin{align*}    g(x, \\zeta) &= \\frac1{27} ((1+x\\zeta) (1+x\\zeta^2) \\dots (1+x\\zeta^{13}))^4 \\\\   &= \\frac1{27} \\left( -x^{13} \\left(-\\frac1x - \\zeta\\right) \\left(-\\frac1x - \\zeta^2\\right) \\dots \\left(-\\frac1x - \\zeta^{13}\\right) \\right)^4 \\\\   &= \\frac1{27} \\left( -x^{13} \\left(\\left(-\\frac1x\\right)^{13} - 1\\right) \\right)^4 \\\\   &= \\frac1{27} (x^{13} + 1)^4. \\end{align*} But $13$ is prime, so all such $\\omega^k$ with $0<k<13$ are primitive, hence   \\[ h(x) = \\frac{g(x, 1) + 12 g(x, \\omega)}{13} = \\frac1{13} \\left(\\frac{(1+x)^{52}}{27} + 12 \\cdot \\frac{(x^{13} + 1)^4}{27} \\right).\\] Now it suffices to change each $x^S$ to $\\frac1{\\binom{53}{S}}$ and sum the resulting expression.    For the first term, each monomial is of the form , $\\frac1{13 \\cdot 27} \\binom{52}{S} x^S$ , hence each monomial contributes   \\[ \\frac1{13 \\cdot 27} \\cdot \\frac{\\binom{52}{S}}{\\binom{53}{S}} = \\frac1{13 \\cdot 27} \\cdot \\frac{52! \\cdot S! \\cdot (53 - S)!}{53! \\cdot S! \\cdot (52 - S)!} = \\frac{53 - S}{13 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 53}.\\] Summing from $S = 0$ to , $52$ , this contributes a total of . $\\frac1{13 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 53} \\cdot \\frac{53 \\cdot 54}{2} = \\frac1{13}$    Now for the second term, we can expand normally to find that the expression is   \\[ \\frac{12}{13 \\cdot 27} \\left( 1 + 4x^{13} + 6x^{26} + 4x^{39} + x^{52} \\right).\\] Ignoring the constant at the front, the first and the last monomial give $1$ and , $\\frac1{53}$ , respectively, while the middle three contribute less than $\\frac{9}{\\binom{53}{12}} \\ll 10^{-9}$ (not enough), hence the answer is   \\[ \\frac1{13} + \\frac{12}{13 \\cdot 27} \\left(1 + \\frac1{53} \\right) = \\frac1{13} + \\frac{12}{13 \\cdot 27} \\cdot \\frac{54}{53} = \\frac{53 + 24}{689} = \\frac{77}{689}. \\]",

We continue drawing slips (without replacement) and playing matches until the results of the match completely determine the order of skill levels of all 36 contestants (i.e. there is only one possible ordering of skill levels consistent with the match results), at which point the tournament immediately finishes.  What is the expected value of the number of matches played before the stopping point is reached?     Proposed by Dilhan Salgado Proposed by Dilhan Salgado",
        "solution": "pretty nice, solved this during my bio class    Let $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 36$ be the players, where a higher number represents a higher skill level. I'll use the notation $i-j$ to denote the match where $i$ plays . $j$ The key is to notice that only the matches of the form $k-(k+1)$ matter (ie, , $1-2$ ,  , $2-3$ , etc). This is because if we play all matches (excluding ) $1-2$ ) involving $1$ and , $2$ , we still won't know who is better between the two players.    The rest is just computation. Obviously, the minimum number of slips needed is $35$ and the maximum is . ${36\\choose 2} = 630$ If we need $n$ slips to determine the order, then we need the $35$ different $k-(k+1)$ slips to be drawn as well as $n-35$ \"extra\" slips. There are ${595\\choose {n-35}}$ ways to choose these extra slips. Next, we fix the last slip to be drawn as one of the $k-(k+1)$ slips. There are $35$ ways to do this. Finally, we simply rearrange the remaining $34$  $k-(k+1)$ slips and the $n-35$ extra slips. There are $(n-1)!$ ways to rearrange these slips. In all, there are $35{595\\choose {n-35}}(n-1)!$ ways to rearrange/pick the slips in order for $n$ slips to determine the order. Each one orderings of these has a $$\\frac 1{630}\\cdot \\frac{1}{629}\\cdots \\frac{1}{631-n}$$ probability of occurring, so the probability that $n$ slips determine the order is $$\\frac1{630}\\cdot \\frac{1}{629}\\cdots \\frac{1}{631-n} \\cdot 35{595\\choose {n-35}}(n-1)!$$  The desired expected value is simply the sum: \\begin{align*} &\\sum_{n = 35}^{630} \\left(n\\cdot \\frac1{630}\\cdot \\frac{1}{629}\\cdots \\frac{1}{631-n} \\cdot 35{595\\choose {n-35}}(n-1)!\\right)\\\\ &=35\\sum_{n = 35}^{630}\\frac{n!{595\\choose {n-35}}}{630\\cdot 629\\cdots \\cdot (631-n)}\\\\ &=35\\sum_{n = 35}^{630}\\frac{\\frac{n!595!}{(n-35)!(630-n)!}}{630\\cdot 629\\cdots \\cdot (631-n)}\\\\ &=35\\sum_{n = 35}^{630}\\frac{\\frac{n!595!}{(n-35)!(630-n)!}}{\\frac{630!}{(630-n)!}}\\\\ &=35\\sum_{n = 35}^{630}\\frac{\\frac{n!595!}{(n-35)!(630-n)!}}{\\frac{630!}{(630-n)!}}\\\\ &=35\\sum_{n = 35}^{630}\\frac{n!595!}{630!(n-35)!}\\\\ &=35\\sum_{n = 35}^{630}\\frac{{n\\choose 35}}{{630\\choose 35}}\\\\ \\end{align*}  Now, we can just apply the hockey stick identity to find that our answer is $$35\\cdot \\frac{{631\\choose 36}}{{630\\choose 35}} = \\boxed{\\frac{22085}{36}}.$$ $\\blacksquare$",

        "text": "Adam places down cards one at a time from a standard 52 card deck (without replacement) in a pile. Each time he places a card, he gets points equal to the number of cards in a row immediately before his current card that are all the same suit as the current card. For instance, if there are currently two hearts on the top of the pile (and the third card in the pile is not hearts), then placing a heart would be worth 2 points, and placing a card of any other suit would be worth 0 points. What is the expected number of points Adam will have after placing all 52 cards?     Proposed by Adam Bertelli Proposed by Adam Bertelli",
        "solution": "really fun problem to solve    Number the cards as follows for convenience: . $\\{A1, A2, \\ldots, A13\\}, \\{B1, B2, \\ldots, B13\\}, \\{C1, C2, \\ldots, C13\\}, \\{D1, D2, \\ldots, D13\\}$ The letter corresponds to the suit of the card. Suppose we place each card in a row, where cards to the left are placed earlier (ie, the leftmost card is the first card placed down). This is obviously equivalent to the original problem.    Now, here's the cool part: Assume we have the following \"placement\" of cards (this is just an example): $$B1, A1, A2, A3, A4, \\ldots$$ The score of card $A2$ is obviously , $1$ , the score of card $A3$ is , $2$ , and the score of card $A4$ is $3$ (this comes from the given scoring system). However, we can also interpret the score of an individual card as the number of \"runs\" of same-suit cards (of any length) that a particular card \"ends\". For example, the card $A4$ \"ends\" exactly $3$ runs - the run , $A3, A4$ , the run , $A2, A3, A4$ , and the run . $A1, A2, A3, A4$ This is obviously true for any arbitrary card.    Using this new definition, we see that the final score is simply the number of runs (of any length) in the entire row. This is now quite easy to count via casework and linearity of expectation.    We wish to find the expected number of runs of length $n$ in the entire row ( ( $n$ will obviously range from $2$ to $13$ in our final answer). There are $53-n$ possible \"locations\" where the run could be. At each one of these locations, there is a $\\frac {12}{51}\\cdot \\frac{11}{50}\\cdots \\frac{14-n}{53-n}$ probability of a run of length $n$ occuring. Thus, the expected number of runs of length $n$ in the entire row is just $$\\left(\\frac {12}{51}\\cdot \\frac{11}{50}\\cdots \\frac{14-n}{53-n}\\right)\\cdot (53-n)$$ by linearity. The expression is equal to $$\\cfrac{\\cfrac{12!}{(13-n)!}}{\\cfrac{51!}{(52-n)!}}\\cdot (53-n) = \\frac{12!(52-n)!\\cdot (53-n)}{51!(13-n)!} = \\frac{12!(53-n)!}{51!(13-n)!}.$$ Summing over all possible \"run-lengths\", we see that the expected score that we will get is $$\\sum^{13}_{n = 2} \\frac{12!(53-n)!}{51!(13-n)!} = \\sum^{13}_{n = 2} \\frac{12!40!(53-n)!}{51!40!(13-n)!} = \\sum^{13}_{n = 2} \\frac{12!40!}{51!}\\cdot {{53-n}\\choose 40}=\\frac{12!40!}{51!}\\sum^{13}_{n= 2}{53-n\\choose 40}.$$ Finally, we can apply the Hockey Stick identity to get that $$\\sum^{13}_{n= 2}{53-n\\choose 40} = {52\\choose 41}$$ , so the final answer is $$\\frac{12!40!}{51!}\\cdot {52\\choose 41} = \\boxed{\\frac{624}{41}}$$ $\\blacksquare$",

It's obvious that primes work; to see that $n = 2p$ works if $p$ is a Fermat prime, note that   \\[\\prod_{\\substack{1\\le k\\le n\\\\\\gcd(k,n) = 1}}(x-k) \\equiv (x - 1)^{p-1} \\equiv x^{p-1} - 1 \\pmod{2}\\] since $p-1$ is a power of 2, and also   \\[\\prod_{\\substack{1\\le k\\le n\\\\\\gcd(k,n) = 1}}(x-k) \\equiv \\prod_{1 \\le k \\le p-1} (x-k) \\equiv x^{p-1} - 1 \\pmod{p}\\] as expected.

Claim. Claim. (Elimination of non-prime powers) If $n$ is not a prime power, then $n$ is twice a Fermat prime.     Proof. Proof. Suppose $p > q$ are two distinct primes dividing . $n$ Then , $(p-1)(q-1) \\mid \\varphi(n)$ , so is a power of,andis a power of.  is a power of,and $q-1$ is a power of , $p$ , and  is a power of. $p-1$ is a power of . $q$  But , $q-1 < p$ , so $q-1 = 1$ and . $q = 2$ Thus $p = 2^s + 1$ for some . $s$    This also demonstrates that 2 and $2^s + 1$ are the only prime factors of , $n$ , so let . $n = 2^e (2^s + 1)^f$ Then . $\\varphi(n) = 2^{e+s-1} (2^s + 1)^{f-1}$ This is supposed to be a power of 2, so . $f = 1$ It is also supposed to be $2^s$ times a power of , $2^s + 1$ , so , $e+s-1 = s$ , whence . $e = 1$ Hence $n = 2(2^s + 1)$ as expected.  Now only prime power $n$ remain to be dealt with. Write , $n = p^e$ , say, with $e \\ge 2$ (since we know $e = 1$ works). Then we require   \\[x^{p^{e-1}(p-1)} - 1 \\equiv \\prod_{\\substack{1 \\le k \\le p^e\\\\p \\nmid k}} (x-k) \\pmod{n}\\] or, upon setting , $x \\mapsto x-1$ ,   \\[(x-1)^{p^{e-1}(p-1)} - 1 \\equiv \\prod_{\\substack{1 \\le k \\le p^e\\\\p \\nmid k-1}} (x-k) \\pmod{n}.\\] It is clear that $x^2$ does not divide the LHS above. However, if , $e \\neq 2$ , then the RHS contains the three distinct factors , $x$ ,  , $x-p$ ,  , $x-p^{e-1}$ , which collectively contain a factor of $x^2$ (as $x$ divides ) $(x-p)(x-p^{e-1})$ )    Thus . $e = 2$ Likewise, if , $p \\neq 2$ , the RHS contains the three distinct factors , $x$ ,  , $x-p$ ,  , $x-2p$ , which multiply to a product divisible by , $x^2$ , contradiction.    Thus , $(p, e) = (2, 2)$ , so , $n = 2^2 = 4$ , as expected.",

There are $\\tbinom{25}{3}-\\tbinom{20}{3}$ such cases; now assume there are no squares.    Note that every number $\\leq 25$ has at most two distinct prime divisors. Thus we write $a=p^uq^v.$ Then we want to characterize the primes $r$ in which $p^uq^v$ is a QR. Since we dispensed of the square case, there are only two more cases:     Case 1 Case 1 : $u\\equiv 1\\mod 2, v\\equiv 0\\mod 2.$  Then this is equivalent to $p$ being a QR. Call this $a$ type 1.   Case 2 Case 2 : $u\\equiv 1\\mod 2,v\\equiv 1\\mod 2.$  In this case, both $p$ and $q$ are either QRs or NQRs. Call this $a$ type 2.    Now consider the case that one of $a,b,c$ is type 1; WLOG it is $a$ with relevant prime factor $p.$ Then to account for the $p$ NQR case, we need one of $b,c$ to be type 2 with prime $p$ and some other prime $q.$ Then to account for the $q$ QR case, we need the other one of $b,c$ to be type $1$ with relevant prime factor $q$ (it can't be type $2$ with some third prime because that creates counterexamples with Dirichlet).    With similar case analysis, the only case where all of $a,b,c$ are type $2$ is when the relevant primes of $a,b,c$ are $\\{p,q\\},\\{q,r\\},\\{r,p\\}.$    We now compute the answer for each case.

Adding everything gives $30$ cases.    For the second case, the primes must be $(2,3,5)$ or $(2,3,7).$ This adds another $4$ cases.  We conclude that there are $\\tbinom{25}{3}-\\tbinom{20}{3}+34=1194$ prime-covering polynomials.

The equation becomes , $a^2+b^2=n(a+b)$ , so ; $a+b\\mid a^2+b^2$ ; equivalently, . $a+b\\mid2ab$ We will find all pairs of positive integers $(a,b)$ satisfying . $a+b\\mid2ab$ Let ; $\\frac{2ab}{a+b}=c$ ; then , $4ab-2ac-2bc=0$ , so . $(2a-c)(2b-c)=c^2$ Let $2a-c=kp^2$ and . $2b-c=kq^2$ Then, , $c=kpq$ , so $a=\\frac{kp^2+kpq}{2}=kp\\cdot\\frac{p+q}{2}$ and . $b=kq\\cdot\\frac{p+q}{2}$    From above, we have $a=kp\\cdot\\frac{p+q}{2}$ and . $b=kq\\cdot\\frac{p+q}{2}$ Since , $a\\neq b$ , we have . $p\\neq q$ Now,   \\[n=\\frac{a^2+b^2}{a+b}=\\frac{k^2\\left(\\frac{p+q}{2}\\right)^2(p^2+q^2)}{k\\frac{(p+q)^2}{2}}=\\frac{k(p^2+q^2)}{2}.\\] We need $k(p^2+q^2)$ to be even for $n$ to be an integer. However, note that since $a+b$ is an integer, $k(p+q)^2$ is even, which implies that $k(p^2+q^2)$ is too. Thus, it is enough for $2a=kp(p+q)$ and $2b=kq(p+q)$ to be even.    The only other restriction we have is that . $p\\neq q$ To satisfy $kp(p+q)$ and $kq(p+q)$ being even, we take $k$ to be an even integer . $2l$ This makes $a$ and $b$ both integers, and makes . $n=l(p^2+q^2)$ If $n$ has a prime divisor congruent to , $1\\pmod{4}$ , then we can set $p^2+q^2$ to this divisor, and we are good.    Conversely, if ' $n$ ' s only prime divisors are congruent to $2$ or , $3\\pmod{4}$ , we show that $n$ cannot be . $\\frac{k(p^2+q^2)}{2}$ If $k$ is even, then letting , $k=2l$ , we have , $n=l(p^2+q^2)$ , which we have problems with, since $p\\neq q$ implies that $p^2+q^2$ has a prime divisor congruent to . $1\\pmod{4}$ If $k$ is odd, then $p^2+q^2$ is even, so . $p\\equiv q\\pmod{2}$ Then, , $n=k\\left(\\left(\\frac{p+q}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{p-q}{2}\\right)^2\\right)$ , so we run into the same problem as when $k$ is even.    So we see that $n$ satisfies the condition if and only if $n$ has a prime divisor congruent to . $1\\pmod{4}$ Now, we simply bash:    5: 5, 10, ..., 50 [10]  13: 13, 26, 39 [13]  17: 17, 34 [15]  29: 29 [16]  37: 37 [17]  41: 41 [18]    The answer is thus . $\\boxed{18}$    Not sure of this solution; can someone check?",

We wish to find the sum of the values ofi.e. the slopes of all lines after they have been rotateddegrees.  Note that by plugginginto the first equation of the system we get the quadraticExpanding and simplifying yields that this quadratic is equivalent toso by Vieta's formulas ifandare the two roots of the above quadratic thenTherefore the sum of all the slopes of the lines for the original parabolaisand the requested answer is. We first make use of a lemma.     LEMMA: LEMMA: Let $F(v)$ be a linear transformation in , $\\mathbb{R}^2$ , and define \\[F(\\mathcal{P})=\\{F(v)\\,|\\, v\\in\\mathcal{P}\\}.\\] Then $F(\\mathcal{P})$ is also a parabola.     Proof. Proof. Omitted.  Use the fact that a conic of the form \\[ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey+f=0\\] is a parabola if and only if . $b^2-4ac=0$    With this in mind, scale the - $y$ - axis by . $\\tfrac5{12}$ This scaling preserves the trisection property of lines and furthermore preserves the tangency of $\\mathcal{P}$ to the $x$ and $y$ axes, and so the answer to the original question will be $\\tfrac{12}5$ the answer to this new problem.  Furthermore, rotate the entire diagram $45^\\circ$ counterclockwise about the origin.  By the arctangent formula, a line with slope $m$ in this frame has a slope of $\\tfrac{1-m}{1+m}$ in the original frame, so it's not hard to transform back and forth.    Let $\\mathcal{P}'$ be the parabola which results from these transformations; then $\\mathcal{P'}$ is tangent to the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$ and the directrix of $\\mathcal{P'}$ is a line parallel to the line . $y=0$ This in turn means that $y=cx^2+d$ for some constants $c$ and . $d$ To deal with the fact that $\\mathcal{P'}$ is tangent to the lines , $y=\\pm x$ , note that this means the equations $y=cx^2-x+d$ and $y=cx^2+x+d$ each have exactly one root.  This means their discriminants are zero, so . $1^2-4cd = 0\\implies d=\\tfrac{1}{4c}$ In fact, we can make $c$ arbitrary due to scaling, so take . $c=1$ This gives , $d=\\tfrac14$ , so the equation of $\\mathcal{P}'$ is now . $y=x^2+\\tfrac14$    Consider any - $\\mathcal{P}'$ - friendly segment with endpoints $(-3a,3a)$ and . $(3b,3b)$ We want $(-a+2b,a+2b)$ and $(-2a+b,2a+b)$ to both be points on . $\\mathcal{P}'$ This gives the system of equations \\[\\begin{cases}a+2b&=(-a+2b)^2+\\frac14,\\\\2a+b&=(-2a+b)^2+\\frac14.\\end{cases}\\] Subtracting the first equation from the second yields \\[a-b=(-2a+b)^2-(-a+2b)^2=(2a-b)^2-(a-2b)^2=3(a+b)(a-b).\\] Hence either $a=b$ or . $a+b=\\tfrac13$ In the former case, this segment is horizontal.  It's clear by the Intermediate Value Theorem (or an analogous argument) that there are precisely two such - $\\mathcal{P}'$ - friendly segments, contributing $2\\cdot\\tfrac{0-1}{0+1}=-2$ to the sum of the slopes of the lines.    On the other hand, if , $a+b=\\tfrac13$ , then let $m=\\tfrac{b-a}{b+a}=3(b-a)=6b-1$ be the slope of the line in question.  We wish to find the sum of the values of \\[\\dfrac{m-1}{m+1}=\\dfrac{6b-2}{6b}=1-\\frac1{3b},\\] i.e. the slopes of all lines after they have been rotated $45$ degrees.  Note that by plugging $a+b=\\tfrac13$ into the first equation of the system we get the quadratic \\[\\frac13+b=\\left(-\\frac13+3b\\right)^2+\\frac14.\\] Expanding and simplifying yields that this quadratic is equivalent to \\[9b^2-3b+\\frac1{36}=0,\\] so by Vieta's formulas if $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the two roots of the above quadratic then \\[\\left(1-\\frac1{3b_1}\\right)+\\left(1-\\frac1{3b_2}\\right) = 2-\\frac13\\left(\\dfrac{b_1+b_2}{b_1b_2}\\right)=2-\\frac13\\left(\\frac{3}{1/36}\\right) = 2-\\frac1{36}.\\] Therefore the sum of all the slopes of the lines for the original parabola $\\mathcal{P}$ is \\[\\dfrac{12}5\\left[-2+\\left(2-\\frac1{36}\\right)\\right]=-\\frac{432}5\\] and the requested answer is . $432+5=\\boxed{437}$",

LEMMA: LEMMA: Let $F(v)$ be a linear transformation in , $\\mathbb{R}^2$ , and define \\[F(\\mathcal{P})=\\{F(v)\\,|\\, v\\in\\mathcal{P}\\}.\\] Then $F(\\mathcal{P})$ is also a parabola.     Proof. Proof. Omitted.  Use the fact that a conic of the form \\[ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey+f=0\\] is a parabola if and only if . $b^2-4ac=0$    With this in mind, scale the - $y$ - axis by . $\\tfrac5{12}$ This scaling preserves the trisection property of lines and furthermore preserves the tangency of $\\mathcal{P}$ to the $x$ and $y$ axes, and so the answer to the original question will be $\\tfrac{12}5$ the answer to this new problem.  Furthermore, rotate the entire diagram $45^\\circ$ counterclockwise about the origin.  By the arctangent formula, a line with slope $m$ in this frame has a slope of $\\tfrac{1-m}{1+m}$ in the original frame, so it's not hard to transform back and forth.    Let $\\mathcal{P}'$ be the parabola which results from these transformations; then $\\mathcal{P'}$ is tangent to the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$ and the directrix of $\\mathcal{P'}$ is a line parallel to the line . $y=0$ This in turn means that $y=cx^2+d$ for some constants $c$ and . $d$ To deal with the fact that $\\mathcal{P'}$ is tangent to the lines , $y=\\pm x$ , note that this means the equations $y=cx^2-x+d$ and $y=cx^2+x+d$ each have exactly one root.  This means their discriminants are zero, so . $1^2-4cd = 0\\implies d=\\tfrac{1}{4c}$ In fact, we can make $c$ arbitrary due to scaling, so take . $c=1$ This gives , $d=\\tfrac14$ , so the equation of $\\mathcal{P}'$ is now . $y=x^2+\\tfrac14$    Consider any - $\\mathcal{P}'$ - friendly segment with endpoints $(-3a,3a)$ and . $(3b,3b)$ We want $(-a+2b,a+2b)$ and $(-2a+b,2a+b)$ to both be points on . $\\mathcal{P}'$ This gives the system of equations \\[\\begin{cases}a+2b&=(-a+2b)^2+\\frac14,\\\\2a+b&=(-2a+b)^2+\\frac14.\\end{cases}\\] Subtracting the first equation from the second yields \\[a-b=(-2a+b)^2-(-a+2b)^2=(2a-b)^2-(a-2b)^2=3(a+b)(a-b).\\] Hence either $a=b$ or . $a+b=\\tfrac13$ In the former case, this segment is horizontal.
