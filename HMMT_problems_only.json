If a piece can move to a square occupied by a king of the opposite color, we say that it is checking the king. If a piece moves to a square occupied by another piece, this is called attacking.",

In RNG baseball, a team of infinitely many people play on a square field, with a base at each vertex; in particular, one of the bases is called the home base. Every turn, a new player stands at home base and chooses a number n uniformly at random from $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Then, the following occurs: • If $n>0$, then the player and everyone else currently on the field moves (counterclockwise) around the square by n bases. However, if in doing so a player returns to or moves past the home base, he/she leaves the field immediately and the team scores one point. • If $n=0$ (a strikeout), then the game ends immediately; the team does not score any more points. What is the expected number of points that a given team will score in this game?",

Balls always bounce in such a way that $\\angle XY A = \\angle BY Z$. This is indicated in the above diagram. Balls bounce off of boundaries in the same way light reflects off of mirrors - if the ball hits the boundary at point P, the trajectory after $P$ is the reflection of the trajectory before $P$ through the perpendicular to the boundary at P. A ball inside a rectangular container of width $7$ and height $12$ is launched from the lower-left vertex of the container.
