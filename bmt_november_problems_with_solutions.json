For example, the player with the number $11$ has binary number . $001011$ For the first and second pitch, they wait; for the third, they swing, and so on. Pitchers follow a similar rule to decide whether to throw a splitter or a fastball, if the bit is , $0$ , they will throw a splitter, and if the bit is , $1$ , they will throw a fastball.  If a batter swings at a fastball, then they will score a hit; if they swing on a splitter, they will miss and get a “strike.” If a batter waits on a fastball, then they will also get a strike. If a batter waits on a splitter, then they get a “ball.” If a batter gets $3$ strikes, then they are out; if a batter gets $4$ balls, then they automatically get a hit.
