You can think of these labels as complex numbers pointing in the direction to fill in the spaces.

(4 digits) I have a random number machine generator that is very good at generating integers between $1$ and $256$, inclusive, with equal probability. However, right now, I want to produce a random number between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, so I do the following:\n\n$\\bullet$ I use my machine to generate a number between $1$ and $256$. Call this $a$.\n\n$\\bullet$ I take a and divide it by $n$ to get remainder $r$. If $r \\ne 0$, then I record $r$ as the randomly generated number. If $r = 0$, then I record $n$ instead.\n\nNote that this process does not necessarily produce all numbers with equal probability, but that is okay.

Then $A$ waits for a while. If $B$ is not eaten by a tiger, then $A$ moves to that point as well.\n\nFrom a point $(x, y)$ there are three places $A$ can tell $B$ to walk to: leftwards to $(x - 1, y)$, downwards to $(x, y-1)$, and simultaneously downwards and leftwards to $(x-1, y-1)$. However, you cannot move to a point with a negative coordinate.\n\nNow, what was this about being eaten by a tiger? There is a tiger at the origin, which will eat the first person that goes there!

You remove a section of the bottom of the paper by cutting along the function $y = f(x)$, where $f$ satisfies $f(1) = f(-1) = 0$.

Two of the cones have radii of $2$, and the other cone has a radius of $3$. The two cones with radii $2$ have height $4$, and the other cone has height $6$.

Bob can paint a house in six hours. If they work together, it takes them seven hours to paint a house. You might be thinking \"What? That's not right!\" but I did not make a mistake.\n\nWhen Alice and Bob work together, they get distracted very easily and simultaneously send text messages to each other. When they are texting, they are not getting any work done.\n\nWhen they are not texting, they are painting at their normal speeds (as if they were working alone). Carl, the owner of the house decides to check up on their work. He randomly picks a time during the seven hours. The probability that they are texting during that time can be written as $r/s$, where r and s are integers and $gcd \\,(r, s) = 1$. What is $r + s$?\n\n\n\nDR 4.

Your job is to fill in as many blanks as you possibly can, including all shaded squares. You do not earn extra points for showing your work; the only points you get are for correctly filled-in squares. You get one point for each correctly filled-in square. You should read through the following rules carefully before starting.\n\n$\\bullet$ Your time limit for this round is $25$ minutes, in addition to the five minutes you get for reading the rules. So make use of your time wisely. The round is based more on speed than on perfect reasoning, so use your intuition well, and be fast.\n\n$\\bullet$ This is a Sudoku puzzle; all the squares should be filled in with the digits $1$ through $9$ so that every row and column contains each digit exactly once. In addition, each of the nine $3\\times 3$ boxes that compose the grid also contains each digit exactly once. Furthermore, this is a super-Sudoku puzzle; in addition to satisfying all these conditions, the four $3\\times 3$ boxes with red outlines also contain each of $1,..., 9$ exactly once. This last property is important to keep in mind – it may help you solve the puzzle faster.\n\n$\\bullet$ Just to restate the idea, you can use the digits $1$ through $9$, but not $0$. You may not use any other symbol, such as $\\pi$ or $e$ or $\\epsilon$. Each square gets exactly one digit.\n\n$\\bullet$ The grid is also a crossword puzzle; the usual rules apply. The shaded grey squares are the “black” squares of an ordinary crossword puzzle. The white squares as well as the shaded yellow ones count as the “white” crossword squares. All squares, white or shaded, count as ordinary Sudoku squares.\n\n$\\bullet$ If you obtain the unique solution to the crossword puzzle, then this solution extends to a unique solution to the Sudoku puzzle.\n\n$\\bullet$ You may use a graphing calculator to help you solve the clues.\n\n\n\nThe following hints and tips may prove useful while solving the puzzle.\n\n\n\n$\\bullet$ Use the super-Sudoku structure described in the first rule; use all the symmetries you have. Remember that we are not looking for proofs or methods, only for correctly filled-in squares.\n\n$\\bullet$ If you find yourself stuck on a specific clue, it is nothing to worry about. You can obtain the solution to that clue later on by solving other clues and figuring out certain digits of your desired solution. Just move on to the rest of the puzzle.\n\n$\\bullet$ As you progress through the puzzle, keep filling in all squares you have found on your solution sheet, including the shaded ones.

We come up with these lower bounds on $a_1$ by remembering all terms must be positive. Then we note that $\\frac{279}{1331} > \\frac{25}{121} > \\frac{2}{11}$ so as we continue to increase $n$ to get values of $a_n$ we get a stricter lower bound on $a_1$. If we continue this infinitely, we will get our smallest value of $a_1$. First we need to find an expression that will give us, based on $n$, the bound for $a_1$. We will break this up into the numerator and denominator. The denominator is simple enough as it will be $11^{n-1}$ for some arbitrary $n$. Finding the numerator will much more difficult but we can note a certain pattern:\n\n$$n = 2 \\Rightarrow 2; n = 3 \\Rightarrow 2 \\cdot 11 + 3; n = 4 \\Rightarrow 2 \\cdot 11^2 + 3 \\cdot 11  +4$$So we now see that the numerator, call it $S$, is defined by $S = \\sum_{k = 2}^{n} \\big( k \\cdot 11^{n-k} \\big)$.

Note that the expression on the right is a finite geometric series and that we can find a common denominator for the expression on the left.\n\n$$ \\frac{10}{11}S = \\frac{2 \\cdot 11^{n-1} -n }{11}  + \\frac{11^{n-2} - 1}{10} $$Finding a common denominator for both of these fractions gives:\n\n$$ \\frac{10}{11}S = \\frac{21 \\cdot 11^{n-1} - 10n -11}{110} \\Rightarrow S = \\frac{21 \\cdot 11^n - 110n - 121}{1100}$$Now we have an expression and we can see that\n\n$$ a_1 > \\frac{21 \\cdot 11^n - 110n - 121}{1100 \\cdot 11^{n-1}}  $$Taking the limit of our expression as $n$ approaches infinity should give us the smallest possible value of $a_1$.\n\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\bigg( \\frac{21 \\cdot 11^n - 110n - 121}{1100 \\cdot 11^{n-1}} \\bigg) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\bigg( \\frac{21}{100} - \\frac{110n + 121}{1100 \\cdot 11^{n-1}} \\bigg)  = \\frac{21}{100}$$So our minimum value of $a_1$ is $\\frac{21}{100}$ which gives $21 + 100  = \\framebox{121}$.",

We shall do this inductively. Take our base case to be when $k = 0$. For some arbitrary $a$ in our set, this gives $a + (1-a) = 1$ which is what was desired. Assume this holds for some $k = j$ so we take our inductive step on $j+1$. We get that $f_{j+1} (a) + f_{j+1} (1-a) = f_j (3a^2 - 2a^3) + f_j (3(1-a)^2 - 2(1-a)^3) \\Rightarrow f_j (3a^2 - 2a^3) + f_j(2 a^3 - 3 a^2 + 1)$. Let $b = 3a^2-2a^3$. We note that $b \\in [0, 1]$ so it is equivalent to using some $a$ in the set. Rewriting for $b$, $f_j (b) = f_j(1-b)$ which we know to be true and completes our induction.

        "solution": "First we will just look at Kenneth's expression. His expression is equivalent to $\\sum_{k=0}^{999} \\frac{1}{\\omega^k -a} $. Note that we can make a polynomial of $(x+a)^{1000} = 1$ which has the roots $\\omega_k -a$. Now that we are just summing the reciprocals of the roots of a polynomial, we can just say it is $\\frac{\\sigma_{999}}{\\sigma_{1000}}$ where $\\sigma_i$ denotes the $i$-th symmetric sum of the roots. We note further that $\\sigma_{999} = {1000 \\choose 999} (-a)^{999} = -1000a^{999}$ and $\\sigma_{1000} = a^{1000}-1$. His expression is $\\frac{-1000a^{999}}{a^{1000}-1}$. Now we move onto Ellen's expression which is much easier to calculate. Note that her sum is equivalent to $\\sum_{k=0}^{999} \\big( \\frac{1}{\\omega^k} -a \\big)$, where our sum is defined in the same way as it is above. Of course, we can now change this into $-1000a + \\sum_{cyc} \\frac{1}{\\omega_k}$. Note that this sum comes from the polynomial $x^{1000}-1 = 0$ and that the $999$-th symmetric sum of the roots of this polynomial is $0$. This gives us Ellen's expression to be just $-1000a$. We now set these equal and find the following polynomial in $a$:\n\n$$ \\frac{-1000a^{999}}{a^{1000}-1} = -1000a \\Rightarrow a^{1001}-a^{999}-a = 0 $$We immediately note that $a =0$ satisfies.

        "solution": "Divide the $6 \\times 6$ grid into nine $2 \\times 2$ square grids. Clearly we can have at most $1$ black square in each $2 \\times 2$ square so each $2 \\times 2$ square has exactly $1$ black square. Now we can describe the position of the black square in the $2 \\times 2$ square as being on the left or right side and on the up or down half. We denote these as $L$ or $R$ and $U$ or $D$ respectively. The condition tells us that two consecutive black squares in a row cannot be $RL$ and two consecutive black squares in a column cannot be $DU$. Then the only $4$ possibilities for a row (from left to right) are $LLL, LLR, LRR$ or $RRR$. Similarly, the only $4$ possibilities for a column are $UUU, UUD, UDD$ or $DDD$. Since there are $3$ rows and $3$ columns, the total number of configuration is $4^{3+3} = 4096$.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, not all of these work. Consider the corners of the middle $2 \\times 2$ square. We have to subtract the cases where one of these corners is shared by two black squares. We proceed with PIE. WLOG the top left corner is shared. There are two ways this can happen:\n\n\n\n1. One black square in the top left $2 \\times 2$ square shares the corner with a black square in the center $2 \\times 2$ square. Then the top row must be $RRR$ because the first one is on the right. In the second row we have $LL \\ \\_$. Since the middle square is $L$ the first one must also be $L$. Then the third one can either be $L$ or $R$. In the third row we can have any of the $4$ possibilities so there are $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$ ways to decide the left/right positions. We also see that there are $8$ ways to decide the up and down positions so there are $8^2=64$ ways to color the gird.\n\n\n\n2. Once black square in the middle left $2 \\times 2$ square shares the corner with a black square in the middle top $2 \\times 2 $ square. Doing the same thing as in case $1$, we see that there are also $8^2=64$ ways to color the grid in this case.\n\n\n\nSince there are $4$ corners, the total number of colorings that have a shared corner is $4 \\cdot (64+64)=512$. Now we have to subtract the number of colorings where two of the corners are shared. We can either have the top right and the bottom left corners shared or the top left and the bottom right corners shared. WLOG the top left and the bottom right corners shared. Then it's easy to see that there are $2$ ways to choose which squares have black square's corners shared and $2^2=4$ ways to color the rest of the grid. Therefore, there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2^2=16$ overcounts. Therefore, the answer is $4096-512+16 = \\boxed{3600}$.",

Over all such choices of $a, b, c$, what is the maximum value achieved by\n\n\\[\\min(a^4 - 4a^3 + 4a^2, b^4 - 4b^3 + 4b^2, c^4 - 4c^3 + 4c^2)?\\]",
        "solution": "Y by Adventure10My very excellent solutionFirst of all, $f(x,y)$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$. Now suppose that $f(a,b)=f(a,c)$; it is apparent that $b-c|f(a,b)-f(a,c)$. Dividing this factor out (since $a,b,c$ are distinct), we see that the remaining factor is\n\n\\[a^2+b^2+c^2+ab+bc+ca-4a-4b-4c+4=0\\]which is symmetric in $a,b,c$ (!!). So, this being true implies that $f(a,b)=f(b,c)=f(c,a)$. Now, seeing as the problem asks for $\\max\\min(a^2(a-2)^2,b^2(b-2)^2,c^2(c-2)^2)$, we make the substitution $a=p+1,b=q+1,c=r+1$, which gives\n\n\\[p^2+q^2+r^2+pq+qr+rp-2=0\\implies (p+q)^2+(q+r)^2+(r+p)^2=4\\]and we want to find\n\n\\[S=\\max\\min((p^2-1)^2,(q^2-1)^2,(r^2-1)^2).\\]Our first try is $p=q=r$, which gives $p^2=q^2=r^2=1/3$ and $S=4/9$. This is the PUMaC, which only accepts integers, so $1$ must be possible somehow. Eventually, you see that $p=q=0$, $r=\\sqrt{2}$ gives $S=1$. Now, we suspect that $S=2$ is not possible (our construction gives $(p^2-1)^2=(q^2-1)^2=(r^2-1)^2=1$). Now suppose that $S=2$ is possible. Then $(p^2-1)^2\\geq2$, so $p^2\\geq1+\\sqrt{2}$ and similarly for $q^2,r^2$. Now, two of $p$ and $q$ have the same sign; WLOG they are $p$ and $q$ and WLOG they are positive (we can negate all of $p,q,r$). Then,\n\n$p+q\\geq\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{2}}+\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{2}}>2$, so $(p+q)^2>4$, which is bad. Thus $S<2$, so $S=\\boxed{1}$.\n\n\n\n(After the test, I realized that the above argument works with any $S>1$; all that happens is that $\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{2}}$ gets replaced with $\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{S}}$, and $2\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{S}}$ is still bigger than $2$.)",

        "solution": "Y by Adventure10I'm not sure which thread is the official thread, so I'll add my solution here as well.\n\n\n\nWe will show that the maximal number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an $n \\times n$ chessboard is $2n - 2.$ Moreover, there are precisely $2^n$ possible bishop placements.\n\n\n\nFrom the top left square of the board, label the $2n - 1$ diagonals (with orientation $\\nearrow$ as opposed to $\\searrow$) $d_1, d_2, \\cdots, d_{2n - 1}.$ Clearly each diagonal can contain only one bishop, for if two bishops belonged to the same diagonal, these two would attack one another. Moreover, $d_1$ and $d_{2n - 1}$ cannot both contain bishops, because $d_1$ consists of only the top left square of the board and $d_{2n - 1}$ consists only of the bottom right square of the board. If a bishop belonged to each of these two squares, then these two bishops would attack one another. Hence, at most $2n - 2$ diagonals can contain bishops, establishing the desired bound. Now, we will show that this bound is attainable.\n\n\n\nWe claim that any bishop on the chessboard attacks at least $n - 1$ squares. Indeed, consider any bishop $B$ and let $d$ be a diagonal passing through $B.$ Let $B$ vary on $d$, and as $B$ varies, let $d'$ be the second diagonal passing through $B.$ If $|d|, |d'|$ denote the number of squares on $d, d'$, then the total number of squares attacked by $B$ is $(|d| - 1) + (|d'| - 1).$ However, $|d'| - 1$ is minimized when $d'$ is as short as possible. This clearly occurs when $B$ belongs the the side of the board. Moreover, it is easy to see that any bishop belonging to the side of the board attacks precisely $n - 1$ squares. Thus, any bishop attacks at least $n - 1$ squares, as desired.\n\n\n\nNow, consider a non-corner square $s$ of the chessboard that does not contain a bishop. Since two diagonals pass through $s$, at most two bishops can attack $s$ (for otherwise, two bishops would belong to the same diagonal, and hence attack one another). Then if $2n - 2$ non-attacking bishops are placed on the chessboard, $n^2 - (2n - 2)$ square do not contain bishops. Therefore, the total number of times a bishop attacks a square is bounded above by $2(n^2 - 2n + 2).$ However, notice that each of the four corner squares can only be attacked by one bishop, not two. Since at least two corner squares are not occupied by a bishop, we may strengthen the above bound as $2(n^2 - 2n + 2) - 2.$ But since each bishop attacks at least $n - 1$ squares, the total number of times a bishop attacks a square is  bounded below by $(n - 1)(2n - 2) = 2(n^2 - 2n + 2) - 2.$ Therefore, equality must occur, in which case all $2n - 2$ bishops belong to the side of the board. It remains to count how many ways this can happen.\n\n\n\nFor $k = 2, 3, \\cdots , n - 1$ it is easy to see that there are exactly two ways in which the bishops belonging to $d_k$ and $d_{2n - k}$ can be placed so that these two bishops belong to the side of the board. Moreover, there are two ways in which the bishop in $d_n$ can be placed. Finally, there are two choices for whether $d_1$ or $d_{2n - 1}$ contains a bishop. Thus we have a total of $2^{n - 2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2^n$ possible bishop placements. $\\square$",

So we want to find the nearest integer to $-x$. Now let's investigate the behavior of the function so we can bound the largest root.\n\n\n\nIf $x$ is some small positive integer, like $1$, we have $f(1)=-2007$. In general, if $x$ is some small positive integer, we see that $x^4-2009x+1$ because for small positive $x$, $2009x>x^4$. And when will this stop? When $x$ is around somewhere between $12$ and $13$. If it get's any larger than that, then $x^4-2009x+1$ will blow up to infinity as $x$ gets larger. Hence the largest root of $f$ is between $12$ and $13$ Let's bound this further.\n\n\n\nWe know that $f(12)=-3371$, and $f(13)=2445$. We have reason to believe that $x$ is closer to $13$, because $2445$ is closer to $0$ than $-3371$ to $0$, but we must prove our instinct. We see that $f(12.5)$ is negative, so $12.5<x<13\\implies -13>-x>-12.5$, so the closest integer is $\\boxed{-13}$.",

        "solution": "Y by Adventure10There is a clever official solution, but I am nowhere as clever as that, so here's a straightforward solution:\n\nStraightforward Expectation SolutionConsider the place $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots$. At every instance of $a_i,a_{i+1}$ we set up a \"test function\", $f(i)$; if both $i$ and $i+1$ are in $S$, then $f(i)=1$; else $f(i)=0$ (this is a common trick in expectation problems). We then see that the problem desires\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}f(i)\\right]=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\mathbb{E}[f(i)].$$Since we are interested in avoiding previously present numbers (let us call them colors henceforth), for each of the $2016$ colors we set up another test function, $g(j)$; if color $j$ is present in $a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1}$, then $g(j)=1$; else $g(j)=0$. Hence we see that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{2016}g(j)\\right]$ is the expected number of present colors between $a_1$ and $a_{i-1}$, inclusive. Note that $\\mathbb{E}[g(j)]=1-\\left(\\frac{2015}{2016}\\right)^{i-1}$, since the probability that color $j$ shows up somewhere is one minus the probability that it never shows up at all, meaning all of the $i-1$ $a$'s are one of the other $2015$ colors. Hence by linearity of expectation the expected number of present colors between $a_1$ and $a_{i-1}$ (henceforth denoted $C_{i-1}$) is $2016-\\frac{2015^{i-1}}{2016^{i-2}}$.\n\nNow it is time to compute $\\mathbb{E}[f(i)]$. Firstly, $i$ must be in $S$ (let's call this $i$ is good). In order for $i$ to avoid previously present colors, it must be one of the $2016-C_{i-1}$ colors, which occurs with probability $$\\frac{2016-C_{i-1}}{2016}=\\frac{2015^{i-1}}{2016^{i-1}}$$(we didn't really need expectation to tell us that...). Suppose that the color of $a_i$ is color $k$.\n\nNow, given that $i$ is good, we must re-evaluate the expected number of present colors between $a_1$ and $a_i$, or $C_{i\\ \\text{given}\\ i}$, henceforth denoted as $D_i$. Again $D_i=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{2016}g(j)_{\\text{given }i}\\right]=1+\\sum_{j\\neq k}\\mathbb{E}[g(j)]$, since $\\mathbb{E}[g(k)]=1$ (we know for sure color $k$ occurs at $a_i$; keep in mind that we also know that color $k$ never appears before $a_i$). Note $\\mathbb{E}[g(j)]=1-\\left(\\frac{2014}{2015}\\right)^{i-1}$ for $j\\neq k$, since $k$ never appears previous to $a_i$, meaning the pool of possible colors decreases by one for $a_1$ through $a_{i-1}$. Then we see $D_i=1+2015\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2014}{2015}\\right)^{i-1}\\right)=2016-\\frac{2014^{i-1}}{2015^{i-2}}$. In order for $i+1$ to be good, $a_{i+1}$ must avoid all these colors, which occurs with probability $$\\frac{2016-D_i}{2016}=\\frac{2014^{i-1}}{2015^{i-2}2016}.$$Hence the probability that both $i$ and $i+1$ are good (and thereby the value of $f(i)$) is\n\n$$\\frac{2015^{i-1}}{2016^{i-1}}\\cdot\\frac{2015^{i-1}}{2016^{i-1}}=\\frac{2015}{2016}\\left(\\frac{2014}{2016}\\right)^{i-1}.$$Summing this from $i=1$ to $\\infty$, we see that the desired answer is\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\mathbb{E}[f(i)]=\\frac{2015}{2}.$$Which gives a $pq$ of $\\fbox{4030}$.\n\nedit: can someone please tell me how to latex box a non-nice number, e.g. a fraction or expression???????? \\fbox{} doesnt appear to work on $\\frac{2015}{2}$...\n\nThis post has been edited 1 time.

        "solution": "Y by Adventure10There is a clever official solution, but I am nowhere as clever as that, so here's a straightforward solution:\n\nStraightforward Expectation SolutionConsider the place $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots$. At every instance of $a_i,a_{i+1}$ we set up a \"test function\", $f(i)$; if both $i$ and $i+1$ are in $S$, then $f(i)=1$; else $f(i)=0$ (this is a common trick in expectation problems). We then see that the problem desires\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}f(i)\\right]=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\mathbb{E}[f(i)].$$Since we are interested in avoiding previously present numbers (let us call them colors henceforth), for each of the $2016$ colors we set up another test function, $g(j)$; if color $j$ is present in $a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1}$, then $g(j)=1$; else $g(j)=0$. Hence we see that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{2016}g(j)\\right]$ is the expected number of present colors between $a_1$ and $a_{i-1}$, inclusive. Note that $\\mathbb{E}[g(j)]=1-\\left(\\frac{2015}{2016}\\right)^{i-1}$, since the probability that color $j$ shows up somewhere is one minus the probability that it never shows up at all, meaning all of the $i-1$ $a$'s are one of the other $2015$ colors. Hence by linearity of expectation the expected number of present colors between $a_1$ and $a_{i-1}$ (henceforth denoted $C_{i-1}$) is $2016-\\frac{2015^{i-1}}{2016^{i-2}}$.\n\nNow it is time to compute $\\mathbb{E}[f(i)]$. Firstly, $i$ must be in $S$ (let's call this $i$ is good). In order for $i$ to avoid previously present colors, it must be one of the $2016-C_{i-1}$ colors, which occurs with probability $$\\frac{2016-C_{i-1}}{2016}=\\frac{2015^{i-1}}{2016^{i-1}}$$(we didn't really need expectation to tell us that...). Suppose that the color of $a_i$ is color $k$.\n\nNow, given that $i$ is good, we must re-evaluate the expected number of present colors between $a_1$ and $a_i$, or $C_{i\\ \\text{given}\\ i}$, henceforth denoted as $D_i$. Again $D_i=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{2016}g(j)_{\\text{given }i}\\right]=1+\\sum_{j\\neq k}\\mathbb{E}[g(j)]$, since $\\mathbb{E}[g(k)]=1$ (we know for sure color $k$ occurs at $a_i$; keep in mind that we also know that color $k$ never appears before $a_i$). Note $\\mathbb{E}[g(j)]=1-\\left(\\frac{2014}{2015}\\right)^{i-1}$ for $j\\neq k$, since $k$ never appears previous to $a_i$, meaning the pool of possible colors decreases by one for $a_1$ through $a_{i-1}$. Then we see $D_i=1+2015\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2014}{2015}\\right)^{i-1}\\right)=2016-\\frac{2014^{i-1}}{2015^{i-2}}$. In order for $i+1$ to be good, $a_{i+1}$ must avoid all these colors, which occurs with probability $$\\frac{2016-D_i}{2016}=\\frac{2014^{i-1}}{2015^{i-2}2016}.$$Hence the probability that both $i$ and $i+1$ are good (and thereby the value of $f(i)$) is\n\n$$\\frac{2015^{i-1}}{2016^{i-1}}\\cdot\\frac{2015^{i-1}}{2016^{i-1}}=\\frac{2015}{2016}\\left(\\frac{2014}{2016}\\right)^{i-1}.$$Summing this from $i=1$ to $\\infty$, we see that the desired answer is\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\mathbb{E}[f(i)]=\\frac{2015}{2}.$$Which gives a $pq$ of $\\fbox{4030}$.\n\nedit: can someone please tell me how to latex box a non-nice number, e.g. a fraction or expression???????? \\fbox{} doesnt appear to work on $\\frac{2015}{2}$...\n\nThis post has been edited 1 time.

The city has placed $6$ roadblocks on lattice point intersections $(x,y)$ with $0\\leq x,y \\leq 6$.

How many sets of $6$ locations could the city have blocked?",
        "solution": "This problem is basically begging to be solved using block walking, so let's see if we can find a recurrence for it. First, note that either each row must have a roadblock or each column might have a roadblock, or both (in the case of going straight down the diagonal). WLOG, we will say that all of the columns have a roadblock. For block walking, I will refer to grid walking paths as \"Michael's walking\", while \"Our walking\" will refer to the placing of roadblocks.\n\n\n\nFirst, note that there must be a roadblock at $(1,5)$, as otherwise, Michael could just walk from $(0,5)\\to(1,5)\\to(1,6)$. We will use this as the start of our block walking. Since each column must have a roadblock, our next roadblock must appear either at $(2,5)$ or $(2,4)$, as otherwise, Michael could just walk from $(1,4)\\to(2,4)\\to(2,5)\\to(2,6)$. Therefore, we can walk (place a roadblock) on any adjacent space directly to the right or diagonally down/right from our current location.\n\n\n\nNow, let's say we place the roadblock at $(2,4)$. We now have three options to choose from, $(3,5)$, $(3,4)$ and $(3,3)$ (Any other option would allow $(2,3)\\to(3,3)\\to(3,4)\\to(3,5)\\to(3,6)).$ Therefore, from any point with a roadblock, we can also walk (place a roadblock) to any adjacent space diagonally up/right from our current location, as long as we are not placing on any point in the form $(a,6)$, as those must remain open.\n\n\n\nAgain, let's say we place the roadblock at $(3,3)$. We now have four options to choose from $(4,5)$, $(4,4)$, $(4,3)$, and $(4,2)$ (otherwise $(3,2)\\to(4,2)\\to(4,3)\\to(4,4)\\to(4,5)\\to(4,6))$. So finally, we can piece together that from any space $(a,b)$ with a roadblock, we have options $(a,b-1)$, $(a,b)$, $\\dots$, $(a,5)$. From there, we can finally commence with our block walking.\n\n\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n---&---&---&---&---&---&---\\\\\n\\hline\n---&1&1&2&5&14&42\\\\\n\\hline\n---&---&1&2&5&14&42\\\\\n\\hline\n---&---&---&1&3&9&28\\\\\n\\hline\n---&---&---&---&1&4&14\\\\\n\\hline\n---&---&---&---&---&1&5\\\\\n\\hline\n---&---&---&---&---&---&1\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nAdding up this last column (except for the bottom right $1$), we get $42+42+28+14+5=131$.

What is the minimal $n$ such that there exist prime numbers $p_1,\\dots,p_n$ which construct any graph $G$ with $N$ vertices?",
        "solution": "Before proceeding, first remark that we may reformulate the problem as a coloring problem: color each vertex with a set of colors such that two vertices are adjacent iff their color sets intersect.  This is sufficient because in the number theory interpretation we may assume WLOG all the labels are squarefree.\n\n\n\nI claim the answer is $n = N$ for $N\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $n=\\lfloor\\tfrac{N^2}4\\rfloor$ otherwise.\n\n\n\nFirst we show that this is necessary.  For $N\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, the graph with no edges suffices.  For $N\\geq 4$, let $r = \\tfrac N2$, and consider the bipartite graph $G = K_{\\lfloor r\\rfloor, \\lceil r\\rceil}$.  For each edge $e\\in E(G)$, let $\\mathcal C_e$ denote the set of colors which appear on both vertices of that edge.  Note that $\\mathcal C_e$ is nonempty.  Further remark that all $\\mathcal C_e$'s are disjoint.  Indeed, if there existed two edges $\\{a_1,b_1\\}$ and $\\{a_2,b_2\\}$ for which this intersection is nonempty, then at least three vertices would have the same color, implying the existence of a triangle in $G$.  It follows that the number of colors necessary is at least $|E(G)| = \\lfloor\\tfrac{N^2}4\\rfloor$.\n\n\n\nNow we show this is sufficient.  We proceed by induction on $N$.  The base case of $N=4$ is tedious but not hard to check.  Now for the inductive step, assume the proposition for some $N\\in\\mathbb N$, and consider any graph $G$ on $N+1$ vertices.  Let $w$ be the vertex in $G$ of smallest degree.  We now case on the degree of $w$.\n\n\nFirst suppose that $d := \\deg w \\leq \\tfrac {N+1}2$, and label the vertices in the neighborhood of $w$ by the labels $w_1,\\ldots, w_d$.  Remove $w$ and all edges connecting to $w$ to form a new graph $G'$.  By the induction hypothesis, $G'$ can be colored in $\\lfloor\\tfrac{N^2}4\\rfloor$ colors.  Now when adding $w$ back in, we may use $d$ new colors (unless $d=0$, in which case we use one new color), where the $k^{\\text{th}}$ new color is applied to vertices $w$ and $w_k$; it is clear that this new coloring works.  As a result, we have used at most\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N^2}4\\right\\rfloor + d \\leq \\left\\lfloor\\frac{N^2}4\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{N+1}2\\right\\rfloor \\leq \\left\\lfloor\\frac{(N+1)^2}4\\right\\rfloor \n\\]colors, and so this case is satisfied.\nNow suppose that $d > \\tfrac{N+1}2$, and consider the graph $G_0$ formed by only the edges connecting two elements in $w \\cup N(w)$.  The crucial claim is that there are at most $\\tfrac{N+1}2$ connected components in this graph.  It is sufficient to show that the degree of each vertex in this graph is at least $1$, for then each connected component has size at least $2$.  To prove this, let $w\\in V(G_0)$ be arbitrary, and consider the neighborhood $N(w)$ of $w$ in $G$.  If for the sake of contradiction $N(w)\\cap N(v)=\\varnothing$, then we obtain the inequality\n\n\\[\nN+1 \\geq |N(v)\\cup N(w)|\\geq |N(v)| + |N(w)| > \\frac{N+1}2 + \\frac{N+1}2 = N+1,\n\\]contradiction.  Hence $v$ and $w$ share a common neighbor $v'$, and so $\\{w,v'\\}\\in E(G_0)$.  As a result, when doing the same inductive process as in the first case, we can add at most $\\lfloor\\tfrac{N+1}2\\rfloor$ colors, one for each connected component in $G_0$.\n\nWe have exhausted both cases, and so by the Principle of Mathematical Induction we're done.",

Thus, our goal is to minimize $x$. This leads us to take the limit of $f(n)$ as each $e_i$ goes to $\\infty$, which yields $\\frac{1}{3^x}$.

        "text": "Find the remainder of\n\n$$\\prod_{n = 2}^{99} (1 - n^2 + n^4)(1 - 2n^2 + n^4)$$when divided by $101$.",
        "solution": "We can easily find $\\prod_{n=2}^{99}(1-2n^2+n^4) = \\prod_{n=2}^{99}(n^2-1)^2 \\equiv 19 \\mod 101$ through Wilson's Theorem.\n\n\n\nNow we deal with the other product. Write $\\prod_{n=2}^{99}(1-n^2+n^4)=\\prod_{n=2}^{99}\\left( \\frac{n^6+1}{n^2+1} \\right)$. We want to find $\\prod (n^6+1) \\mod 101$ and divide it by $\\prod (n^2+1) \\mod 101$. For the time being, we will ignore the cases where $n^2+1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 101$, which occur when $n=10, 91$.\n\nClaim: $n^6$ and $n^2$ have the same set of residues modulo $101$ when $2 \\le n \\le 99$.\n\n\n\nProof: First we introduce a lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma: $a^3 \\equiv b^3 \\mod 101 \\Rightarrow a \\equiv b \\mod 101$ for $1 \\le a, b \\le 100$.\n\n\n\nProof: Rearrange and factor the condition to get $(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2) \\equiv 0 \\mod 101$. A well-known lemma states that if a prime $p \\equiv 2 \\mod 3$ and $ p | (a^2+ab+b^2)$, then $p | a$ and $p | b$. So clearly $a^2+ab+b^2$ can't be divisible by $101$, leaving $a \\equiv b \\mod 101$, as desired.\n\n\n\nThe lemma implies that every distinct value of $x^2$ mod $101$ generates a distinct value of $x^6$ mod $101$. Then noting that for every value of $x^6$ mod $101$, there exists a distinct quadratic residue such that they are equal mod $101$, we can see that the claim is true. $\\square$\n\nNow our only worry is that there exists an $x \\ne 10, 91$ such that $x^6 \\equiv -1 \\mod 101$. However, we can quickly see this is not the case.\n\n\n\nSo we get a bunch of cancellation and are left with $\\prod_{n=2}^{99}(1-n^2+n^4) \\equiv (1-10^2+10^4)(1-91^2+91^4) \\equiv 9 \\mod 101$.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is $9 \\cdot 19 \\mod 101 = \\boxed{70}$.",

We have that $$0\\leq a_k,b_k,c_k\\leq e_i$$WLOG $c_k\\leq b_k$. Simple testing of numbers shows that if the minimum of the triple, or $c_k$ is $i$, then we have $(e_i+1-i)(e_i+2-i)$ ways to select $a_k$ and $b_k$. Summing this over all $i$ yields $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=1}^{e_i+1}n(n+1)$ as the number of ways to choose $(a_k,b_k,c_k)$ if $c_k$ is the minimum.

Thus, our goal is to minimize $x$. This leads us to take the limit of $f(n)$ as each $e_i$ goes to $\\infty$, which yields $\\frac{1}{3^x}$. Since we want $f(n)<\\frac{1}{2018}$, our smallest possible value of $x$ is $7$, so our answer is simply $2+3+5+7+11+13+17=\\boxed{58}$.\n\nThis post has been edited 1 time.

        "solution": "Y by Adventure10, Mango247Let us say $n$ is a part number if a square can be partitioned into $n$ smaller, (or of equal size) non-overlapping squares. Since any square can be further partitioned into four equal squares, we have that if $n$ is a part number then $n+3$ is also a part number. $n=1, 4$ is obviously a part number. $6$ is a part number since five $1 \\times 1$ squares and a $2 \\times 2$ square can be gathered to form a $3 \\times 3$ square. $7$ is a part number since $4$ is. $8$ is a part number since seven $1 \\times 1$ square and a $3 \\times 3$ square can be gathered to form a $4 \\times 4$ square.\n\nNow we claim $5$ is the largest non-part number among positive integers. To prove that consider a square in the plane with vertices $A$, the origin, $B(1,0)$, $C(1,1)$ and $D(0,1)$. Suppose that the square $ABCD$ has been partitioned into five smaller squares. Note that each of the vertex $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ should be a vertex of one of the five squares and none of them have two vertex among $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$. Therefore, we have four squares positioned at the each four corners. Let the side lengths of squares at the corners of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ be $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$. We have inequality $a+b \\le 1$, $b+c \\le 1$, $c+d \\le 1$, $d+a \\le 1$. Clearly, we should have three equalities to have the complement square. Without loss of any generality, suppose that $a+b =1$, $b+c=1$, $c+d=1$.  Then we have $a+d=1$ which contradicts that the complement square is of positive size. Therefore, $n=5$ is the largest non-part number.\n\n\n\nIt is an old problem. By the way, this have also appeared as the first problem in  KMO 2016 second round.",

Say two permutations intersect if they share a number in the same place, as per the JMO notation.\n\n\n\nGiven permutations of ${1,...2n}$ I claim that the minimal number of permutations needed such that every other permutation intersects at least one is $n+1$.  To prove this, just consider the permutations ${1,2,...n+1,n+2,..2n}$, ${2,3,...n+1,1,n+2,...2n}$, ... ${n+1,1,...n,n+2,...2n}$, the $n+1$ permutations where the first $n$ are cyclically permuted.  Clearly a permutation that does not intersect this has to have all of its $1$, $2$, ... $n+1$ among the last $n-1$ terms, impossible.  The JMO problem is just the $n=1005$ case of this direction.\n\n\n\nNow, we show that given any $n$ permutations there exists one that does not intersect it.  Examine what numbers are allowed to go where in a permutation that doesn't intersect ant of these $2n$.  We represent the $2n$ numbers by boys, and note that any number is allowed to go in at least $n$ spaces - the $n$ permutations have that number in at most $n$ different spaces, so at least $n$ are left.  Now, any space is allowed to have at least $n$ numbers for the same reason - at most $n$ are used up in the permutations.  These spaces are girls.  We have $2n$ boys and $2n$ girls, and everyone likes at least $n$ people of the opposite gender.  In a set of $1 \\le k \\le n$ boys clearly they like at least $n$ girls.  Since every girl likes at least $n$ boys, a set of at least $n+1$ boys will be liked by all girls.  So then by Hall's marriage lemma, we can find a perfect matching between spaces and numbers.  This gives rise to a permutation that does not intersect the existing one.\n\n\n\nTherefore, $n+1$ is the minimal number of permutations needed such that any permutation intersects at least one of them.  The case $n=1007$ yields our result.",

Suppose that $n+1 = 3 \\cdot 2^{i}$ and $n-1 = 2^{j}$ with $i+j = x$. Then $2 = 3 \\cdot 2^{i} - 2^j$, and clearly $i<j$ so $2 = 2^{i}(3 - 2^{j-i})$. Thus $2^{i} = 1$ or $2$, so $i = 0, 1$.

Furthermore, let $R$ be the circumradius and $K$ be the area of $\\triangle ABC$.  We consider $[CRO]$ and $[COW]$ separately.  First look at $\\triangle CRO$.  It's area is equal to $\\tfrac12RC\\cdot R\\sin\\angle OCR$. Remark that since $CO$ and $CR$ are isogonal $\\angle OCR=\\angle DCB$, whose sine is trivially $\\tfrac{DB}a$.  Furthermore, by altitude to hypotenuse on $\\triangle DAC$ we obtain $CD^2=CR\\cdot b\\implies CR=\\tfrac{CD^2}b$.  Therefore \\[[CRO]=\\tfrac12RC\\cdot R\\sin\\angle OCR=\\dfrac12R\\left(\\dfrac{CD^2}b\\right)\\left(\\dfrac{DB}a\\right)=\\dfrac{R\\cdot CD^2\\cdot DB}{2ab}.\\] The formula $R=\\tfrac{abc}{4K}$ simplifies this expression quite a bit, making it equal \\[\\dfrac{abc\\cdot CD^2\\cdot DB}{8abK}=\\dfrac{c\\cdot CD^2\\cdot DB}{8K}.\\] This is where magic happens: note that $c\\cdot CD$ is itself two times the area of the triangle, so we may substitute $2K$ for this and simplify the expression all the way down to \\[\\dfrac{2K\\cdot CD\\cdot DB}{8K}=\\dfrac{CD\\cdot DB}4.\\] Similarly, $[COW]=\\tfrac{CD\\cdot DA}4$.  Therefore \\[[CROW]=\\dfrac{CD\\cdot DA}4+\\dfrac{CD\\cdot DB}4=\\dfrac{CD(DA+DB)}4=\\dfrac{CD\\cdot c}4=\\dfrac K2,\\] which amazingly implies that the area of $[CROW]$ is half the area of the original triangle.  Finally, by Heron's we obtain \\[[ABC]=\\sqrt{42(42-15)(42-34)(42-35)}=\\sqrt{2^4\\cdot 3^4\\cdot 7^2}=252,\\] so the desired answer is $\\tfrac{252}2=\\boxed{126}.$\n\n\n\nAlso, funny story: right before the contest a few of us on our team were giving other team members tips to solving PUMaC problems in various disciplines.  One of the things I said for the geometry contest was something along the lines of \"a good thing to know is that the circumcenter and orthocenter are isogonal conjugates - it has a chance of appearing in one of the problems.\"",

        "solution": "Y by Adventure10, Mango247Let us say $n$ is a part number if a square can be partitioned into $n$ smaller, (or of equal size) non-overlapping squares. Since any square can be further partitioned into four equal squares, we have that if $n$ is a part number then $n+3$ is also a part number. $n=1, 4$ is obviously a part number. $6$ is a part number since five $1 \\times 1$ squares and a $2 \\times 2$ square can be gathered to form a $3 \\times 3$ square. $7$ is a part number since $4$ is. $8$ is a part number since seven $1 \\times 1$ square and a $3 \\times 3$ square can be gathered to form a $4 \\times 4$ square.\n\nNow we claim $5$ is the largest non-part number among positive integers. To prove that consider a square in the plane with vertices $A$, the origin, $B(1,0)$, $C(1,1)$ and $D(0,1)$. Suppose that the square $ABCD$ has been partitioned into five smaller squares. Note that each of the vertex $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ should be a vertex of one of the five squares and none of them have two vertex among $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$. Therefore, we have four squares positioned at the each four corners. Let the side lengths of squares at the corners of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ be $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$. We have inequality $a+b \\le 1$, $b+c \\le 1$, $c+d \\le 1$, $d+a \\le 1$. Clearly, we should have three equalities to have the complement square. Without loss of any generality, suppose that $a+b =1$, $b+c=1$, $c+d=1$.  Then we have $a+d=1$ which contradicts that the complement square is of positive size. Therefore, $n=5$ is the largest non-part number.\n\n\n\nIt is an old problem. By the way, this have also appeared as the first problem in  KMO 2016 second round.",

Therefore, by a trivial induction, $\\psi(3^n) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{3^n\\pi}{16}\\right)$.\n\nSo our sequence goes (after reducing $\\pmod{2\\pi}$ and starting from $\\psi(3)$) \\[2\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{16}\\right), 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{9\\pi}{16}\\right), 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{27\\pi}{16}\\right), 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{17\\pi}{16}\\right), 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{19\\pi}{16}\\right), 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{25\\pi}{16}\\right), 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{11\\pi}{16}\\right), 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{16}\\right), 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{16}\\right), \\ldots\\]\n\n\n\nIn particular it repeats every 8 terms. As an added bonus, note the first four terms have the same product as the next 4 terms (since $\\cos(x) = -\\cos(x+\\pi)$). So we just need to find $2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{16}\\right) \\cdot 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{16}\\right) \\cdot 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{9\\pi}{16}\\right) \\cdot 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{27\\pi}{16}\\right)$ and take it to the 25th power. Simple trig identities do the job.\n\n\n\n$2\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{16}\\right) \\cdot 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{9\\pi}{16}\\right) \\cdot 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{27\\pi}{16}\\right) \\cdot 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{17\\pi}{16}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{16}\\right) \\cdot 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{16}\\right) \\cdot 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{16}\\right) \\cdot 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{16}\\right) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right) \\cdot 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{8}\\right) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right) \\cdot 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n\n\nSo our answer is $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{2}^{25}}\\rfloor = \\boxed{5792}$.\n\n\n\nDarn darn darn at PUMAC, I actually did everything correctly, except I summed from $n = 0$ to $n = 99$, so my answer was negative ($-5793$ to be specific). And I misread Algebra A1 as integers instead of positive integers. I hate negative numbers. Why can't we be more positive?",

Since any edge of the graph must belong either to the matching $M$ or to (at least) one star centered at an end of an edge in the matching $M$, it follows the total number of edges is at most $(k-1) + 2(k-1)(k-2) = (k-1)(2k-3)$.\n\n\n\nThis http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~niranj/papers/matching.pdf boasts to have found the precise sharp bound for the number of edges; see the expression for $e_0$ at the bottom of page 6.\n\nA previous determination of this value is in http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316572901033,\n\nnamely $k(k-1)$ for $k$ odd, and $(k-1)^2 + \\dfrac {k-2} {2}$ for $k$ even.",

There's ten of these groups. Thus, the sum of the units digits is $10(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)=10(45)=450$. We notice that there's actually a symmetric case for the tens digit with respect to the units digit, as long as we put a 0 implied in the tens digit for numbers less than 10, so a total of $450$ is contributed by the tens digit as well. Our final answer, the sum of the two quantities, is $450+450=\\boxed{900}$.",

We're interested in the units digit; anything multiplied by 5 will either have units digit 5 or 0, so we omit 5.  Thus we're looking at all numbers of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 67^c$ with units digit 2, with a, b, and c nonnegative integers.\n\n\n\nI will use frequency to denote the number of values for a.  The units digit of $2^a$ could be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 6, with frequency 1, 503, 503, 502, and 502, respectively; the units digit of $3^b$ could be 3, 9, 7, or 1, with frequency 503, 503, 502, 503, respectively; and the units digit of $67^c$ could be 7, 9, 3, or 1, with frequency 503, 503, 502, 503, respectively.  Now we do casework.\n\n\n\nCase 1: If the units digit of $2^a$ is 2\n\n\n\nWe have 4 pairs for the units digit of $3^b$ and $67^c$: (3,7), (9,9), (7,3) and (1,1).  So the number of divisors is\n\n\\[503(503^2 + 503^2 + 502^2 + 503^2) = 503 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 503^2 + 502^2)\\]  if the units digit of $2^a$ is 2.\n\n\n\nCase 2: If the units digit of $2^a$ is 4\n\n\n\nThe pairs for units digit of $3^b$ and $67^c$ are (3,1), (9,7), (7,9), and (1,3).  So the number of divisors is\n\n\\[503(503^2 + 503^2 + 502 \\cdot 503 + 503 \\cdot 502) = 503 \\cdot 502 \\cdot 2010\\]  if the units digit of $2^a$ is 4.\n\n\n\nCase 3: If the units digit of $2^a$ is 8\n\n\n\nThe pairs for units digit of $3^b$ and $67^c$ are (3,3), (9,1), (7,7), and (1,9).  So the number of divisors is\n\n\\[502(503 \\cdot 502 + 503^2 + 502 \\cdot 503 + 503^2) = 502 \\cdot 503 \\cdot 2010\\]  if the units digit of $2^a$ is 8.\n\n\n\nCase 4: If the units digit of $2^a$ is 6\n\n\n\nThe pairs for units digit of $3^b$ and $67^c$ are (3,9), (9,3), (7,1), and (1,7).

Clearly, the number of divisors in cases 2, 3, and 4 are divisible by 2010, so those go away, so our answer will be $503 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 503^2 + 502^2)$ mod 2010.  Now\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}3 \\cdot 503^2 + 502^2 &=& (503^2 + 502^2) + 2 \\cdot 503^2\\\\ &=& (503 + 502)^2 - 2 \\cdot 503 \\cdot 502 + 2 \\cdot 503^2\\\\ &=& 1005^2 + 2 \\cdot 503\\\\ &=& 1004 \\cdot 1005 + 1005 + 1006\\\\ &\\equiv& 1005 + 1006\\pmod{2010}\\\\ &\\equiv& 1\\pmod{2010}\\end{eqnarray*}  So $1 \\cdot 503 = \\boxed{503}$ mod 2010.\n\n\n\nClearly the above was an overkill, and there is a paragraph-long solution to this",

The equation is of the form \\[a=t+\\sqrt{b- t}\\] it is very natural to move everything to one side and write it as \\[a-b-1/4+(b-t)-\\sqrt{b- t}+1/4=0\\] or also $a-b-1/4+\\left(\\sqrt{b- t}-1/2\\right)^2=0$.

This provides a standard and straightforward method in which you can diagonalize any symmetric quadratic form - basically by completing squares in the appropriate way. Applying that theorem to our little problem may be a bit of an  overkill, but at least it shows some connection of this problem to some classical area of mathematics, making it less sketchy.",

The latter case is not a solution, as it implies that $p=45$ (shown above), so we take the first case.\n\n\n\nIf one of $a,b,c$ is even (say $a$), then $p = 2^4+b^4+c^4 - 3 =  b^4+c^4 + 13$. Suppose $b,c\\neq5$, then $b^4+c^4+13 \\equiv 1+1+13 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5$, but $p>5$ so this can not happen. Hence, at least one of $b,c$ is equal to $5$. If $b=c=5$, then $p=5^4+5^4+13 = 1263 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$, so it can not happen.\n\nHence, only one of $b,c$ (say $b$) is equal to $5$, so $p=5^4+c^4+13 = c^4+638$. If $c \\neq 3$, then $p=c^4+638 \\equiv 1+638 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$, but $p>3$, so this can not happen. Therefore, $c=3$ and $p=3^4+638 = 719$, which is indeed prime. This finishes the case.\n\n\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{p=719}$ is the only possible value for $p$, and $(a,b,c)$ can be any permutation of $(2,5,3)$.",

Multiplying the two relations yields $10^{x+y} n^2 < 10^n < 10^{x+y} (n+1)^2$.\n\n\n\nIf we denote $s_1, s_2$ to be the number of digits of $2^n, 5^n$ respectively, then we have that $s_1=x+2, s_2=y+2$. Note that $10^{s_1-1}<2^n < 10^{s_1}, 10^{s_2-1}<5^n<10^{s_2}$. So we have $10^{s_1+s_2-2}<10^n<10^{s_1+s_2} \\Longrightarrow n= s_1+s_2-1=x+y+3$.\n\n\n\nGoing back to the original inequality, plugging $n=x+y+3$ in yields $10^{x+y}n^2<10^{x+y+3}<10^{x+y}(n+1)^2 \\Longrightarrow n^2<1000<(n+1)^2$. The only positive integer $n$ satisfying this is $\\boxed{n=31}$.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn intuitive way to think about it is to note that since $2^n\\cdot 5^n=10^n$ and they have the same two leftmost digits, then these two digits have to be the first two digits of $\\sqrt{10}\\approx 3.16227766$, so $\\boxed{31}$.

The latter case is not a solution, as it implies that $p=45$ (shown above), so we take the first case.\n\n\n\nIf one of $a,b,c$ is even (say $a$), then $p = 2^4+b^4+c^4 - 3 =  b^4+c^4 + 13$. Suppose $b,c\\neq5$, then $b^4+c^4+13 \\equiv 1+1+13 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5$, but $p>5$ so this can not happen. Hence, at least one of $b,c$ is equal to $5$. If $b=c=5$, then $p=5^4+5^4+13 = 1263 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$, so it can not happen.\n\nHence, only one of $b,c$ (say $b$) is equal to $5$, so $p=5^4+c^4+13 = c^4+638$. If $c \\neq 3$, then $p=c^4+638 \\equiv 1+638 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$, but $p>3$, so this can not happen. Therefore, $c=3$ and $p=3^4+638 = 719$, which is indeed prime. This finishes the case.\n\n\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{p=719}$ is the only possible value for $p$, and $(a,b,c)$ can be any permutation of $(2,5,3)$.",

Multiplying the two relations yields $10^{x+y} n^2 < 10^n < 10^{x+y} (n+1)^2$.\n\n\n\nIf we denote $s_1, s_2$ to be the number of digits of $2^n, 5^n$ respectively, then we have that $s_1=x+2, s_2=y+2$. Note that $10^{s_1-1}<2^n < 10^{s_1}, 10^{s_2-1}<5^n<10^{s_2}$. So we have $10^{s_1+s_2-2}<10^n<10^{s_1+s_2} \\Longrightarrow n= s_1+s_2-1=x+y+3$.\n\n\n\nGoing back to the original inequality, plugging $n=x+y+3$ in yields $10^{x+y}n^2<10^{x+y+3}<10^{x+y}(n+1)^2 \\Longrightarrow n^2<1000<(n+1)^2$. The only positive integer $n$ satisfying this is $\\boxed{n=31}$.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn intuitive way to think about it is to note that since $2^n\\cdot 5^n=10^n$ and they have the same two leftmost digits, then these two digits have to be the first two digits of $\\sqrt{10}\\approx 3.16227766$, so $\\boxed{31}$.

        "solution": "Y by mathisreal, Williamgolly, Adventure10, and 1 other userFactorizing, \\[q^2 = (r - p)(r^2 + rp + p^2)\\] Suppose some $x|q$ satisfies $x | r - p$ and $x | r^2 + rp + p^2$. Then $x | (r^2 + rp + p^2) - (r - p)^2 = 3rp$. But $3 \\nmid q$ and $p \\nmid q$, so $x | r$. Then since $x | r - p$, $x | p$, so $x = p$, contradicting the fact that $p \\nmid q$. Then $r - p$ and $r^2 + rp + p^2$ are coprime, so each is the perfect square of an integer. In particular, \\[r^2 + rp + p^2 = y^2\\] \\[(2r + p)^2 + 3p^2 = (2y)^2\\] \\[(2y + 2r + p)(2y - 2r - p) = 3p^2\\] Since $y > p$, from the first equation, the first of the two factors is strictly larger than $3p$, so it is either $p^2$ or $3p^2$. If it equals $p^2$, the other factor is $3$, so $y = \\frac{p^2 + 3}{4}$ and $r = \\frac{p^2 - 2p - 3}{4}$. Otherwise, $y = \\frac{3p^2 + 1}{4}$ and $r = \\frac{3p^2 - 2p - 1}{4}$\n\n\n\nNext, we use the fact that $r - p$ is also a square. In the first case, this number is \\[\\frac{p^2 - 6p - 3}{4}\\] This number is strictly between $(\\frac{p - 5}{2})^2$ and $(\\frac{p - 3}{2}^2)$ unless $p^2 - 10p + 25 \\ge p^2 - 6p - 3$, or $p \\le 7$. But $r - p$ is only positive for $p \\ge 7$, so we only need to test $7$. It is in fact a working value (take, for instance $r = 8$ and $q = 13$).\n\n\n\nIn the second case, $r - p = \\frac{3p^2 - 6p - 1}{4}$ If $p = 4k + 1$, this is just $12k^2 - 1$ which is $3 \\pmod{4}$ and not a perfect square. If $p = 4k + 3$, this is $12k(k + 1) - 2$ which is $2 \\pmod{4}$ and not a square. Thus the only such prime is $p = 7$.\n\n\n\nQuite a comprehensive problem .

What is the probability that the two line segments intersect?\n\n\n\nThis problem was surprisingly difficult.  It took me a really long time to figure out how to get integrals that actually converged.  There are many different expressions that you can come up with to represent the same areas, and many different limits of integration you can choose, but only one combination of all these formulas and limits of integration leads to convergence.  I'm still not 100% sure why it should actually matter which order you integrate in, but anyway, here goes:\n\n\n\nWe choose $A = (x_a, y_a)$ randomly in the square and draw the line from $(0, 0)$ to $A$.  The equation of this line is:\n\n\n\n$L_1: y = \\frac{y_a}{x_a}x$\n\n\n\nNext, we draw the line passing through points $(1, 0)$ and $A$.  The equation of this line is:\n\n\n\n$L_2: y = \\frac{y_a}{1-x_a}(1-x)$\n\n\n\nFor a fixed $A$, the line segment from any other point $B$ to $(1, 0)$ will intersect with $L_1$ if and only if $B$ is in the interior of the region bounded on the right by the lines $L_1$, $L_2$, and on the left by the edge of the square.  Thus, for a fixed $A$, the probability of choosing such a $B$ is given by the area under this region.\n\n\n\nWe need to consider two cases:\n\n\n\nCase 1:  When $y < 1-x$, this region is a simple triangle whose base is on the $y$-axis.  The length of the base is given by $\\frac{y_a}{1-x_a}$, and the height of the triangle is given simply by $x_a$.  Hence the area of this triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{x_a y_a}{1-x_a}$.  To find the total probability for all possible choices of $A$, we integrate over the lower left portion of the unit square.  This is given by:\n\n\n\n$P_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1-x} \\frac{y x}{1-x} dy dx$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x}{1-x} \\left[\\frac{y^2}{2}\\right]^{1-x}_{0} dx$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{1} x(1-x) dx$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{24}$\n\n\n\nNote that the order of integration here is important.  If we integrate with respect to $x_a$ first, we will get an expression involving a logarithm which will diverge over the limits of integration.  But by integrating with respect to $y_a$ first, the denominators cancel out.\n\n\n\nCase 2: When $y > 1-x$, the problem is more difficult because the shape of the region is a trapezoid instead of a triangle.\n\n\n\nFirst, let $K$ be the point of intersection of $L_1$ and the line $y=1$, and note that $K = \\left(\\frac{x_a}{y_a}, 1\\right)$.  Let $J$ be the point of intersection of $L_2$ and the line $y=1$, and we calculate $J = \\left(1-\\frac{1-x_a}{y_a}, 1\\right)$.  Also let $O$ be the origin, and $P = (0,1)$.  The region we are trying to find the area of is trapezoid $OPJA$, and is given by the area of triangle $OPK$ minus the area of triangle $KJA$.  There are other ways to compute the area of this region as well, but they lead to expressions which result in non-converging integrals.\n\n\n\nTriangle $KJA$ has base $\\frac{x_a}{y_a} - \\left(1-\\frac{1-x_a}{y_a}\\right) = \\frac{1}{y_a} - 1$ and height $1-y_a$, so its area is given by $\\frac{1}{2}(1-y_a)\\left(\\frac{1-y_a}{y_a}\\right)$\n\n\n\nTriangle $OPK$ has base $1$ and height $\\frac{x_a}{y_a}$, so its area is given by $\\frac{x_a}{2y_a}$.\n\n\n\nHence, the area of region $OPJA$ is given by $\\frac{x_a}{2y_a} - \\frac{(1-y_a)^2}{2y_a}$\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we need to integrate over the upper right half of the unit square, which is given by:\n\n\n\n$P_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{y}\\int_{1-y}^{1} x - (1-y)^2 dx dy$\n\n\n\nHere notice that we have changed the order of integration from the previous region for the same reason that we need to integrate first with respect to whichever variable will not yield a logarithm.\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{y} \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2} - (1-y)^2 x\\right]_{1-y}^{1} dy$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{y} \\left[\\frac{1}{2} - (1-y)^2 - \\frac{(1-y)^2}{2} + (1-y)^3\\right] dy$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{1}3y - 2y^2 dy$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac{3y^2}{2} - \\frac{2y^3}{3}\\right]_0^1$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{5}{24}$\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the probability is given by $P_1 + P_2 = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}$",

We solve the problem in general, replacing $2007$ with $n$. Note that every desired permutation can be split into two blocks, each of which is only increasing. For example, $2671345$ splits into $267$ and $1345$. Also note that picking a subset $S \\subset \\{1, 2, \\dots , n \\}$ for the elements of the first block uniquely determines the order of the first block (increasing) and uniquely determines the second block and its order (increasing). In other words, the number of good subsets is equal to the number of valid permutations. However, not all subsets $S$ give valid blocks, since for there to be a decrease from the first to second block, the maximum element of the first block (or $S$) must be greater than the minimum element of the second block.\n\n\n\nIn order to count the number of such subsets, we look at the complement: the number of subsets $S$ for which the maximum element of the first block (or $S$) is less than the minimum element of the second block. This only occurs when $S=\\{1\\}, \\{1,2\\},\\dots,\\{1, 2, \\dots , n \\}$. In addition, $S$ can't be empty since the first block can't be empty. So there are a total of $n+1$ bad subsets. The number of good subsets $S$, which represents the number of good permutations, is $2^n - n -1 $. For $n=2007$, the answer becomes $\\boxed{2^{2007}-2008}$.\n\n\n\nI also found a generalization of this problem, the Eulerian numbers, which is the number of permutations of the first $n$ integers for which there are exactly $m$ ascents (increases).",

It took me a really long time to figure out how to get integrals that actually converged.  There are many different expressions that you can come up with to represent the same areas, and many different limits of integration you can choose, but only one combination of all these formulas and limits of integration leads to convergence.  I'm still not 100% sure why it should actually matter which order you integrate in, but anyway, here goes:\n\n\n\nWe choose $A = (x_a, y_a)$ randomly in the square and draw the line from $(0, 0)$ to $A$.  The equation of this line is:\n\n\n\n$L_1: y = \\frac{y_a}{x_a}x$\n\n\n\nNext, we draw the line passing through points $(1, 0)$ and $A$.  The equation of this line is:\n\n\n\n$L_2: y = \\frac{y_a}{1-x_a}(1-x)$\n\n\n\nFor a fixed $A$, the line segment from any other point $B$ to $(1, 0)$ will intersect with $L_1$ if and only if $B$ is in the interior of the region bounded on the right by the lines $L_1$, $L_2$, and on the left by the edge of the square.  Thus, for a fixed $A$, the probability of choosing such a $B$ is given by the area under this region.\n\n\n\nWe need to consider two cases:\n\n\n\nCase 1:  When $y < 1-x$, this region is a simple triangle whose base is on the $y$-axis.  The length of the base is given by $\\frac{y_a}{1-x_a}$, and the height of the triangle is given simply by $x_a$.  Hence the area of this triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{x_a y_a}{1-x_a}$.  To find the total probability for all possible choices of $A$, we integrate over the lower left portion of the unit square.  This is given by:\n\n\n\n$P_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1-x} \\frac{y x}{1-x} dy dx$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x}{1-x} \\left[\\frac{y^2}{2}\\right]^{1-x}_{0} dx$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{1} x(1-x) dx$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{24}$\n\n\n\nNote that the order of integration here is important.  If we integrate with respect to $x_a$ first, we will get an expression involving a logarithm which will diverge over the limits of integration.  But by integrating with respect to $y_a$ first, the denominators cancel out.\n\n\n\nCase 2: When $y > 1-x$, the problem is more difficult because the shape of the region is a trapezoid instead of a triangle.\n\n\n\nFirst, let $K$ be the point of intersection of $L_1$ and the line $y=1$, and note that $K = \\left(\\frac{x_a}{y_a}, 1\\right)$.  Let $J$ be the point of intersection of $L_2$ and the line $y=1$, and we calculate $J = \\left(1-\\frac{1-x_a}{y_a}, 1\\right)$.  Also let $O$ be the origin, and $P = (0,1)$.  The region we are trying to find the area of is trapezoid $OPJA$, and is given by the area of triangle $OPK$ minus the area of triangle $KJA$.  There are other ways to compute the area of this region as well, but they lead to expressions which result in non-converging integrals.\n\n\n\nTriangle $KJA$ has base $\\frac{x_a}{y_a} - \\left(1-\\frac{1-x_a}{y_a}\\right) = \\frac{1}{y_a} - 1$ and height $1-y_a$, so its area is given by $\\frac{1}{2}(1-y_a)\\left(\\frac{1-y_a}{y_a}\\right)$\n\n\n\nTriangle $OPK$ has base $1$ and height $\\frac{x_a}{y_a}$, so its area is given by $\\frac{x_a}{2y_a}$.\n\n\n\nHence, the area of region $OPJA$ is given by $\\frac{x_a}{2y_a} - \\frac{(1-y_a)^2}{2y_a}$\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we need to integrate over the upper right half of the unit square, which is given by:\n\n\n\n$P_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{y}\\int_{1-y}^{1} x - (1-y)^2 dx dy$\n\n\n\nHere notice that we have changed the order of integration from the previous region for the same reason that we need to integrate first with respect to whichever variable will not yield a logarithm.\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{y} \\left[\\frac{x^2}{2} - (1-y)^2 x\\right]_{1-y}^{1} dy$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{y} \\left[\\frac{1}{2} - (1-y)^2 - \\frac{(1-y)^2}{2} + (1-y)^3\\right] dy$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{1}3y - 2y^2 dy$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac{3y^2}{2} - \\frac{2y^3}{3}\\right]_0^1$\n\n\n\n$= \\frac{5}{24}$\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the probability is given by $P_1 + P_2 = \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}$",

Notice that, for any $l$ coprime to 100, $\\sigma(l) \\equiv kl \\pmod{100}$ must be coprime to 100 as well. Let us say $k_1l \\equiv k_2l \\pmod{100}$ for some $k_1, k_2$ coprime to and less than 100. Then, we have $(k_1 - k_2)l \\equiv 0 \\pmod{100}$; $l \\equiv 0 \\pmod{100}$ is impossible, so we must have $k_1 - k_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{100} \\implies k_1 = k_2$. Therefore, $\\sigma(l)$ is distinct for each $k$, and since $\\sigma(l)$ must be coprime to 100 as well, the possible values for $\\sigma(l)$ are simply the possible values for $k$, i.e. $f(l) = f(1) = 2000$. $\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\nClaim 4: $f(n) \\le 2000$ for any $n$.\n\n\n\nProof. We have already proven this for $n$ coprime to 100, so we will assume $\\gcd(n, 100) \\ne 1$. Let $m = \\gcd(n, 100)$. Then we have $n = mn'$ where $\\gcd(n', 100) = 1$. Let $g = \\frac{100}{m}$. Let us consider all $x \\le g$ such that $x$ is coprime to 100. If we let $x' = x + yg$ for any integer $0 \\le y \\le m - 1$, we know $x'$ is coprime to 100 as well, and $nx \\equiv mn'x \\equiv mn'(x + yg) \\equiv mn'x' \\pmod{100}$. Therefore, if two different values of $\\sigma(1)$ are congruent mod $g$, then $\\sigma(n)$ in each case will be equal, so we need only consider $\\sigma(1) \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, g\\}$. Finally, we have\n\n\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(n) &= \\sum_{i = 1,\\ \\gcd(i, 100) = 1}^g (i \\cdot n\\bmod{100}) \\le \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i = 1,\\ \\gcd(i, 100) = 1}^{100} (i \\cdot m \\cdot n' \\bmod{100}) \\\\\n&\\le \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot m \\sum_{i = 1,\\ \\gcd(i, 100) = 1}^{100} (i \\cdot n' \\bmod{100}) = \\sum_{i = 1,\\ \\gcd(i, 100) = 1}^{100} (i \\cdot n' \\bmod{100}) = 2000\n\\end{align*}\n\nbecause $n'$ is coprime to 100. $\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\nClaim 5: $f(n) \\ge 50$ for any $n$.\n\n\n\nFirst we verify that this is achievable. We know that $k = \\sigma(1)$ must be odd, so $\\sigma(50) = 50\\sigma(1) \\bmod 100 = 50(2l + 1) \\bmod 100 = 50$ for any possible value of $k$, and so $f(50) = 50$.\n\n\n\nNext, we show that this is optimal. Say there exists some $n$ such that $\\sigma(n)$ can be $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\dots$ such that $\\sum_i p_i < 50$. Clearly, $p_i < 50$ as well. If we define $m$, $g$, and $y$ as before, we have that $p_i + yg \\bmod 100$ must also be a valid $p$. We have either $g = 100$ or $g \\mid 50$. The first case is only possible when $n$ is coprime to 100 and we have shown $f(n) = 2000$ in this case so we do not need to consider it. In the second case, there exists some integer $y$ such that $yg = 50$, and we can simply take some $p$ and add $yg$ to get another $p$ greater than 50, contradiction. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(n)$ is 50. $\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\nThe answer is $2000 - 50 = \\fbox{1950}$ (this solution is probably unnecessarily long). $\\square$",

Let $b = p_ib'$ and $m = p_im'$, so $\\gcd(b', m') = 1$. Clearly, the number of possible values for $b'$ given $p_i$ is $\\phi(m') = \\phi(\\frac{m}{p_i})$. If $a_i$ is 1, then this becomes\n\n\n\n$$\\frac{m}{p_i} \\cdot \\frac{(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1})(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2})(\\dots)}{1 - \\frac{1}{p_i}} = \\frac{\\phi(m)}{p_i(1 - \\frac{1}{p_i})} = \\frac{\\phi(m)}{p_i - 1}$$.\n\n\n\nIf $a_i > 1$, this becomes\n\n\n\n$$\\frac{m}{p_i} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{p_1})(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2})(\\dots) = \\frac{\\phi(m)}{p_i}$$\n\nSumming over all $p_i$ (there is no overcounting because the gcd can only be one prime), we get $r(m) = \\phi(m)(\\sum_{i : a_i > 1} \\frac{1}{p_i} + \\sum_{i : a_i = 1} \\frac{1}{1 - p_i})$. $\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\nSo, we have $\\phi(m) = r(m) = \\phi(m)(\\sum_{i : a_i > 1} \\frac{1}{p_i} + \\sum_{i : a_i = 1} \\frac{1}{1 - p_i}) \\implies \\sum_{i : a_i > 1} \\frac{1}{p_i} + \\sum_{i : a_i = 1} \\frac{1}{1 - p_i} = 1$. Notice that $m$ can be composed of no more than 4 distinct primes as $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 > 300$. Additionally, if 2 is not a factor of $m$, then it can be composed of no more than 3 distinct primes as $3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 > 300$.\n\n\n\nThus we need to find sequences of unit fractions $\\frac{1}{n_1}, \\frac{1}{n_2}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{n_i}$ that sum up to 1 ($i \\le 4$). WLOG, say $n_{j + 1} \\ge n_j$ (statement 1).\n\n\n\nFirst, let us find sequences for $i = 1$. The only such sequence is $\\frac{1}{1}$, so we need $p_1 = 1$ and $a_1 > 1$ or $p_1 - 1 = 1 \\implies p_1 = 2$ and $a_1 = 1$. The first case is invalid because 1 isn't a prime, but the second case is valid, so $m = 2$ is a possible solution.\n\n\n\nLet us assume $\\frac{1}{2}$ isn't in a sequence with $i > 1$. Then, the maximum value for the sum is $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1$ (as 3 is the next prime after 2, and there can only be up to 3 primes if 2 isn't a factor). Clearly, this sequence is invalid because we may have $p_1 = 3$ and $p_2 - 1 = 3$, but we can't find a value for $p_3$ without repeating a prime. Any other sequence following statement 1 and not including $\\frac{1}{2}$ must have a sum less than 1. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2}$ must be in the sequence, i.e. $n_1 = 2$.\n\n\n\nFor $i = 2$: The only such sequence is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}$. We have $p_1 = 2$, $a_1 > 1$, $p_2 - 1 = 2 \\implies p_2 = 3$, $a_2 = 1$. Therefore we have $m = 2^k \\cdot 3$, $k > 1$, which is the same as $m = 2^{k'} \\cdot 12$, $k' \\ge 0$. We see that $m = 2^{k'} \\cdot 12 < 300$ implies $2^{k'} < 25$, so $k' \\le 4$. Finding the sum of all $m$ of this form, we find $12(2^0 + 2^1 + \\dots + 2^4) = 372$.\n\n\n\nFor $i = 3$: The only such sequences are $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6}$. The first sequence is invalid because it requires some $p_i = 4$, but 4 isn't prime. The second sequence works, and it implies $p_1 = 2, a_1 > 1, p_2 = 3, a_2 > 1, p_3 = 7, a_3 = 1$. If we take the minimum possible $m$ of this form, we get $m = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 = 252$. Multiplying by 2 or 3 would exceed the bound of 300, so 252 is the only solution of this form.\n\n\n\nFor $i = 4$: Notice that $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = 1$, so we must have $n_2 \\le 6$ (otherwise the sum would be less than 1). Clearly $n_2 \\ge 3$ as well (because if $n_2$ were 2 the sum would be greater than 1). Then, we can find all such sequences for each possible value of $n_2$ and see that none of them are valid.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible $m$ is $2 + 372 + 252 = \\fbox{626}$.\n\nThis post has been edited 3 times.

There are some nontrivial identities that allow for computing larger Fibonacci numbers with fewer steps, but those of us who don't memorize these identities can settle for enumerating the first 23 terms of the Fibonacci sequence by doing a bunch of manual addition.

If we break this $14$-move sequence into the left-right subsequence of length $2k$ and the up-down subsequence of length $2(7-k)$, then each of these subsequences needs to be a valid instance of the aforementioned number line counting problem for $n = k$ and $n = 7 - k$, respectively. Conversely, for any move sequences $M_1$ and $M_2$ that are valid instances of these respective counting problems and for any $2k$-element subset $S_1$ of $\\{1, \\ldots, 14\\}$, we can make a valid $14$-move sequence whose subsequence over the indices in $S_1$ is $M_1$ and whose subsequence over the remaining indices (in $\\bar{S_1}$) is $M_2$. Hence, the answer is\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{7} \\binom{14}{2k}C_kC_{7-k} = 2\\sum_{k=0}^{3}\\binom{14}{2k}C_kC_{7-k}$$(this equality holds because the mapping $k \\mapsto 7 - k$ maps $0, 1, 2, 3$ to $7, 6, 5, 4$ and does not change the value of the summand).\n\n\n\nUsing the formula $C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1}\\binom{2n}{n}$, the answer becomes\n\n$$2\\sum_{k=0}^{3} \\frac{14!}{(2k)!(2(7-k))!}\\cdot\\frac{1}{(k+1)(8-k)}\\cdot\\frac{(2k)!}{(k!)^2}\\cdot\\frac{(2(7-k))!}{((7-k)!)^2} = 2\\left(\\frac{14!}{1\\cdot 8\\cdot 1^2\\cdot (7!)^2} + \\frac{14!}{2\\cdot 7\\cdot 1^2\\cdot (6!)^2} + \\frac{14!}{3\\cdot 6\\cdot 2^2\\cdot (5!)^2} + \\frac{14!}{4\\cdot 5\\cdot 6^2\\cdot (4!)^2}\\right),$$which evaluates to $\\boxed{613470}$.\n\n\n\nRemark.

        "text": "15. Let $a_{n}$ denote the number of ternary strings of length $n$ so that there does not exist a $k<n$ such that the first $k$ digits of the string equals the last $k$ digits. What is the largest integer $m$ such that $3^{m} \\mid a_{2023}$ ?",
        "solution": "Y by This problem involves both combinatorics and number theory -- I'll start the discussion with the combinatorics part.\n\n\n\nCall a ternary string a $k$-repeater if its first (leftmost) $k$-digit substring equals its last (rightmost) $k$-digit substring. For a ternary string $d$, let $f(d)$ denote the smallest positive integer $k$ for which $d$ is a $k$-repeater. Call $d$ primitive if $f(d)$ is the length of $d$.\n\n\n\nLet $n$ be the length of the string $d = d_1d_2\\ldots d_n$. We first show that if $d$ is not primitive, then $f(d)$ is necessarily at most $n/2$. By way of contradiction, if $2f(d) > n$, then the leftmost and rightmost substrings of $d$ of length $f(d)$ must overlap in the middle. Specifically, if we let $s$ be the substring $d_1\\ldots d_{f(d)}$ and $t$ be the substring $d_{n-f(d)+1}\\ldots d_n$, then $s$ must equal $t$, so for each $i \\in \\{n - f(d) + 1, \\ldots, f(d)\\}$, we have $s_i = d_i = t_{i-(n-f(d))} = s_{i-(n-f(d))}$. Therefore, the first $2f(d) - n$ digits of $s$ must match the last $2f(d) - n$ digits of $s$, so the first $2f(d) - n$ digits of $d$ must match the last $2f(d) - n$ digits of $d$. Because $d$ is not primitive, $f(d) < n$, so $2f(d) - n = f(d) + (f(d) - n) < f(d)$, so $d$ is a $k$-repeater for $k$ equal to $2f(d) - n$, which is less than $f(d)$; this contradicts the definition of $f(d)$.\n\n\n\nFor any $n$ and $k$ with $1 \\leq k \\leq \\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$, any $n$-digit string $d$ with $f(d) = k$ can be uniquely generated by picking a unique primitive $k$-digit string $s$, picking a unique $(n-2k)$-digit string $t$, and setting $d = sts$. The number of ways to choose $s$ is $a_k$, and the number of ways to choose $t$ is $3^{n-2k}$. Thus, there are $3^{n-2k}a_k$ strings $d$ with $n$ digits with $f(d) = k$. There are $3^n$ total strings $d$ with $n$ digits, so the number of primitive $n$-digit strings is\n\n$$a_n = 3^n - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} 3^{n-2k}a_k.$$Some easy base cases are $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = 3$. We can eliminate the summation from this recurrence relation in several ways. Here are a few:\n\n\n\nFor $n \\geq 2$, observe that\n\n$$a_{n-2} = 3^{n-2} - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor - 1} 3^{n-2-2k}a_k = \\frac{1}{9}\\left(3^n - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor - 1} 3^{n-2k}a_k\\right) = \\frac{a_n + 3^{n-2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} a_{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}}{9},$$so $a_n = 9a_{n-2} - 3^{n-2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} a_{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}$. In other words, when $n$ is even, $a_n = 9a_{n-2} - a_{n/2}$, and when $n$ is odd, $a_n = 9a_{n-2} - 3a_{(n-1)/2}$. Also, for odd $n$, $\\lfloor(n - 1)/2\\rfloor$ equals $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$, so\n\n$$a_{n-1} = 3^{n-1} - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} 3^{n-1-2k}a_k = \\frac{a_n}{3} \\implies a_n = 3a_{n-1}.$$\n\nThe remainder of the problem is number theory. Or maybe someone else can find an explicit formula or a more insightful recurrence relation for $a_n$.",

Furthermore, we assume that the $1011$ numbers on both sides are written in some order.\n\nAfter Bob does this, Anna has the opportunity to swap the positions of the two numbers lying on different sides of the paper if they have different parity. Anna wins if, after finitely many moves, all odd numbers end up on the left, in increasing order, and all even ones end up on the right, in increasing order.

Turn the numbers into a single permutation $a_1,\\ldots,a_{2022}$ of $[2n]$ by reading off the first number on the left, then the first number on the right, then the second number on the left, and so on. Thus $1,2$ on the left and $3,4$ on the right would become $1,3,2,4$ (here $n=2$). Then the swapping process corresponds to picking two opposite-parity elements whose positions are also opposite-parity and switching them, so $1,3,2,4 \\to 2,3,1,4$ is illegal but $1,3,2,4 \\to 4,3,2,1$ is legal.\n\n\n\nThen it is easy to verify that the number of same-parity inversions—i.e. the number of pairs $i<j$ such that $a_i>a_j$ and $a_i \\equiv a_j \\pmod{2}$—has invariant parity: whenever we swap $a_i$ and $a_j$, the number of same-parity inversions among $(i,k)$ and $(k,j)$ for $i<k<j$ changes by $\\pm 1$. Since there are an even number of such $k$ the result follows.\n\n\n\nThe desired final state has $0$ same-parity inversions. On the other hand, the starting state $3,2,1,4,5,6,7,8,\\ldots$ has $1$ same-parity inversion, so starting with $3,1,5,7,9,\\ldots$ on the left and $2,4,6,8,10,\\ldots$ on the right will make Anna unable to win.\n\nThis post has been edited 1 time.

The answer is then $F_{n+2}-2$.\n\n\n\nConsider an $n$-tuple of positive integers and consider some maximal element $a_i$ such that $a_{i-1}$ isn't maxima. Then we must have $a_i=a_{i-1}+a_{i+1}$. Now suppose we delete $a_i$; I claim the result is $(n-1)$-nice. Indeed, $a_{i+1} \\equiv a_i \\pmod{a_{i-1}}$, so $a_{i-1} \\mid a_{i-2}+a_i \\implies a_{i-1} \\mid a_{i-2}+a_{i+1}$.

In this case, the $n$-tuple is clearly all $1$'s due to the gcd condition (every element is maximal), in which case the claim still holds, so it's true in general.\n\n\n\nI now claim that for $n \\geq 2$, the maximal element of an $n$-tuple is at most $F_n$, and the second-largest element is at most $F_{n-1}$. This follows by induction: first off, the only good $1$-tuple is $(1)$, so the only good $2$-tuples are $(1,2)$ and $(1,1)$ up to cyclic permutations; thus the claim is true for $n=2$. Now if the claim is true for $n$, it immediately follows that the maximal element of a good $(n+1)$-tuple $T$ is at most $F_{n+1}$, since it's the sum of two elements of the $n$-tuple $T'$ obtained by deleting it. Furthermore, the second-largest element of $T$ is still in $T'$, so it's at most $F_n$.\n\n\n\nBy successively deleting maximal elements and applying the above claim, it follows that the maximum value of $a_1+\\cdots+a_n$ is $F_1+\\cdots+F_n$.

There are $4$ ways we can't reach $9$ (2, 4, 8, 2 & 4), and everything else works, so there are $2^6-4$ combinations for this case.\n\n\n\nAdding up the cases, we get $2^4+2+2^8+2^7+2^6-4=16+2+256+128+64-4=462$ ways.

Since $AQ = BQ = 6$, if $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ by the Pythagorean theorem we get $QM = \\sqrt{11}$. Note that $MY = 3$ so $QY = \\sqrt{11 + 3^2} = 2\\sqrt{5}$.\n\n\n\nThen by Power of a Point, $YZ = \\frac{AY \\cdot BY}{QY} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{5}}{5}$ so $QZ = QY + YZ = \\frac{18\\sqrt{5}}{5}$ so the answer is $18 + 5 + 5 = \\boxed{28}$.",
