This only happens when $\\tfrac{\\varphi(n)}{p-1}$ is a power of $p$, which concludes the proof.\n\nClaim. (Elimination of non-prime powers) If $n$ is not a prime power, then $n$ is twice a Fermat prime.\n\n\n\nProof. Suppose $p > q$ are two distinct primes dividing $n$. Then $(p-1)(q-1) \\mid \\varphi(n)$, so\n\n$q-1$ is a power of $p$, and\n$p-1$ is a power of $q$.\n\nBut $q-1 < p$, so $q-1 = 1$ and $q = 2$. Thus $p = 2^s + 1$ for some $s$.\n\n\n\nThis also demonstrates that 2 and $2^s + 1$ are the only prime factors of $n$, so let $n = 2^e (2^s + 1)^f$. Then $\\varphi(n) = 2^{e+s-1} (2^s + 1)^{f-1}$. This is supposed to be a power of 2, so $f = 1$. It is also supposed to be $2^s$ times a power of $2^s + 1$, so $e+s-1 = s$, whence $e = 1$. Hence $n = 2(2^s + 1)$ as expected.\n\nNow only prime power $n$ remain to be dealt with. Write $n = p^e$, say, with $e \\ge 2$ (since we know $e = 1$ works). Then we require\n\n\\[x^{p^{e-1}(p-1)} - 1 \\equiv \\prod_{\\substack{1 \\le k \\le p^e\\\\p \\nmid k}} (x-k) \\pmod{n}\\]or, upon setting $x \\mapsto x-1$,\n\n\\[(x-1)^{p^{e-1}(p-1)} - 1 \\equiv \\prod_{\\substack{1 \\le k \\le p^e\\\\p \\nmid k-1}} (x-k) \\pmod{n}.\\]It is clear that $x^2$ does not divide the LHS above. However, if $e \\neq 2$, then the RHS contains the three distinct factors $x$, $x-p$, $x-p^{e-1}$, which collectively contain a factor of $x^2$ (as $x$ divides $(x-p)(x-p^{e-1})$).\n\n\n\nThus $e = 2$. Likewise, if $p \\neq 2$, the RHS contains the three distinct factors $x$, $x-p$, $x-2p$, which multiply to a product divisible by $x^2$, contradiction.\n\n\n\nThus $(p, e) = (2, 2)$, so $n = 2^2 = 4$, as expected.",

Then WLOG, assume that $P_1 \\in AB$, $P_2 \\in BC$, and $P_3 \\in AD$.

Note that $A \\in \\omega$ so $\\omega$ intersects $BC$ iff, $d(M,BC) \\le AM$ where $M$ is the midpoint of $P_1P_3$ since $\\overline{AM}$ is a radius of $\\omega$. Also $M$ must lie in the upper right quadrant of the square since otherwise $\\omega$ will intersect $BC$ outside of the segment so the desired locus for this particular configuration is the region of points in the upper right quadrant of the square lying to the left of the parabola with focus $A$ and directrix $BC$. Applying the same argument for the other possibilities yields the desired locus.\n\n\n\nNow we compute the area. Scale the square so that its center lies at the origin and $A=(1,1)$. Then the intersection of the parabolas in the upper right quadrant is the intersection of $y=\\tfrac{1}{4}(x-1)^2$ and $y=x$, or $(3-2\\sqrt{2},3-2\\sqrt{2})$.

Thus we write $a=p^uq^v.$ Then we want to characterize the primes $r$ in which $p^uq^v$ is a QR. Since we dispensed of the square case, there are only two more cases:\n\n\n\nCase 1: $u\\equiv 1\\mod 2, v\\equiv 0\\mod 2.$\n\nThen this is equivalent to $p$ being a QR.

Adding everything gives $30$ cases.\n\n\n\nFor the second case, the primes must be $(2,3,5)$ or $(2,3,7).$ This adds another $4$ cases.\n\nWe conclude that there are $\\tbinom{25}{3}-\\tbinom{20}{3}+34=1194$ prime-covering polynomials.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks @below, I forgot a lot of cases where primes have multiplicity $\\geq 2.$ Note that the characterization above matches dj's characterization in post #3.\n\nThis post has been edited 2 times.

        "text": "Consider an undirected, connected graph $G$ with vertex set $\\{v_1,v_2,\\ldots, v_6\\}$.  Starting at the vertex $v_1$, an ant uses a DFS algorithm to traverse through $G$ under the condition that if there are multiple unvisited neighbors of some vertex, the ant chooses the $v_i$ with smallest $i$.  How many possible graphs $G$ are there satisfying the following property: for each $1\\leq i\\leq 6$, the vertex $v_i$ is the $i^{\\text{th}}$ new vertex the ant traverses?",
        "solution": "To solve this problem, it is first important to recall what depth-first search (DFS) is.  In a DFS algorithm, the ant will traverse through the vertices of a graph one at a time, travelling as far as possible before backtracking.  This is done subject to the condition that the ant finishes searching a vertex if and only if all of that vertex's neighbors are already visited.  The following example, taken from the 15-210 Parallel and Sequential Algorithms course textbook, might serve as a good visual aid (although here the DFS is being done on an ordered graph as opposed to an unordered one).  Here, $X$ denotes the set of visited vertices ordered from left to right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the bolded part of the graph indicating the exact edges traversed in the DFS search forms a tree; this makes sense, since such an algorithm never visits a vertex twice (which in turn would create a cycle).  The key to solving this problem is to focus on this underlying tree (called a DFS tree) and use this to develop a recursion that will help enumerate the number of graphs in question.\n\n\n\nConsider any graph $G$ on $n+1$ vertices $\\{v_1,\\ldots, v_{n+1}\\}$ satisfying the property in the question.  Delete the vertex $v_{n+1}$ and all edges incident on it.  Then the resulting graph $G'$ on $n$ vertices $\\{v_1,\\ldots, v_n\\}$ also satisfies the property in question, since the DFS traversal for $G$ must go through the vertices $v_1,\\ldots, v_n$ first before finally reaching $v_{n+1}$.  Now let $P$ denote the unique path connecting vertex $v_1$ to vertex $v_n$ in the DFS tree for $G'$.  The crucial claim is that all of the neighbors of $v_{n+1}$ must be entirely contained in $P$.  Indeed, if this were not the case, then $\\{v_j,v_{n+1}\\}\\in E(G)$ for some $v_j\\notin P$.  Note that by the property in the problem statement, in the DFS tree for $G'$, $v_j$ is traversed before $v_n$.  But now this means that in the DFS tree for $G$, vertex $v_{n+1}$ is traversed before $v_n$, since by definition the ant must visit all neighbors of $v_j$ before backtracking onto $P$.  This is a contradiction, and so indeed all neighbors of $v_{n+1}$ must be located on the path $P$.  In turn, one can construct a graph on $n+1$ vertices by first picking a vertex $v$ in $P$ for the ant to travel to $v_{n+1}$ and then selecting any subset of the vertices in the path from $v_1$ to $v$ not containing $v$ in the DFS tree to add as extra neighbors to $v_{n+1}$.  (These will not affect the correctness of the DFS tree due to the given ordering of the vertices, since the vertex $v_{n+1}$ will still be traversed last.)  The picture below demonstrates this. Here the DFS tree is represented in bold; the remaining dashed edges are optional and lead to the $2^k$ term in the recurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second important step is to recongize that the number of choices for where to place the branching-off point is dependent on the length of $P$.  Thus, for all positive integer pairs $(n,k)$ with $1\\leq k\\leq n-1$, let $G_{n,k}$ denote the number of connected graphs on $\\{v_1,\\ldots, v_n\\}$ satisfying the following two properties:\n\nThe DFS search starting from vertex $v_1$ traverses $v_1,v_2,\\ldots, v_n$ in this order;\nIn the DFS tree for the graph, the distance between vertices $v_1$ and $v_n$ is $k$.\n\nAdditionally, define $G_{n,0} = 0$ for convenience purposes.  Then in order to construct a graph counted in $G_{n+1,k+1}$, the vertex $v_{n+1}$ must be attached to the vertex in the path from $v_1$ to $v_n$ which is distance $k$ away from $v_1$; this can only be done if the length of the path is at least $k$.  Thus, by combining this with the logic above, one establishes the recursion \\[G_{n+1,k+1} = 2^k\\sum_{j=k}^nG_{n,j}.\\]From here, it suffices to compute the $G_{n,k}$ manually.  The computation is a bit intensive when performing the calculations for the $n=6$ case, but it is still doable.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n$G_{n,k}$ & 0 & 1   & 2   & 3   & 4   & 5    \\\\ \\hline\n1         & 0 &     &     &     &     &      \\\\ \\hline\n2         & 0 & 1   &     &     &     &      \\\\ \\hline\n3         & 0 & 1   & 2   &     &     &      \\\\ \\hline\n4         & 0 & 3   & 6   & 8   &     &      \\\\ \\hline\n5         & 0 & 17  & 34  & 56  & 64  &      \\\\ \\hline\n6         & 0 & 171 & 342 & 616 & 960 & 1024 \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\\]The requested answer is the sum of the entries along the bottom row, which is $\\boxed{3113}$.\n\n\n\nRemark: The sequence of answers for various $n$ - 1, 1, 3, 17, 171, 3113, 106419, ... - is sequence A015083 in the OEIS.

Kevin will end up on an A bus if $x\\leq5$ or $x\\leq y$.

The probability that Richard rolls a non-even prime should be $\\frac{2}{6}$, but since $1$ is neither prime nor even, at least not in this century, we can effectively ignore all $1$'s and the probability Richard rolls a non-even prime is $\\frac{2}{5}$. Similarly, the probability for rolling a composite even is $\\frac{2}{5}$, and the probability of rolling an even prime is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\n\n\nArmed with this knowledge, we can turn this problem into a MathCounts states/dynamic problem problem and find a recursion.

There are $\\binom{15}{5} = 3003$ ways to choose 5 of these segments to color red.\n\n\n\nWe then try to find the number of ways she can color 5 segments so that there is at least one triangle. There are $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways to choose a triangle from these 6 vertices. Thus, there are $20 \\binom{12}{2}$ ways to choose 5 segments so that they form at least one red triangle. However, we have overcounted the number of ways when 2 triangles are formed. There are $20$ ways to select the first triangle and then $3$ ways to select a fourth point followed by $3$ ways to select the common edge. Dividing by 2 yields that there are $90$ such ways to choose two triangles.\n\n\n\nThus, we get our final answer of $3003 - 1320 + 90 = \\boxed{1773}$.",

Decomposing $\\pi$ by cycles, we see that each turn the cycles change as follows: an even cycle $a_1 \\to a_2 \\to \\ldots \\to a_{2n} \\to a_1$ gets broken up into two cycles $a_1 \\to a_3 \\to \\ldots \\to a_{2n-1} \\to a_1$ and $a_2 \\to a_4 \\to \\ldots \\to a_{2n} \\to a_2$, and an odd cycle $a_1 \\to a_2 \\to \\ldots \\to a_{2n+1} \\to a_1$ gets shifted as $a_1 \\to a_3 \\to \\ldots a_{2n+1} \\to a_2 \\to a_4 \\ldots a_{2n} \\to a_1$. Crucially, at each turn, an even cycle gets broken up into two cycles of the same (half the original) length, while odd cycles do not change in length.\n\n\n\nThus, eventually, all cycles will have odd length; for the process to end, we need all these cycles to be length $1$, so the cycles of the original permutation $\\pi$ must all have length a power of two. We take cases on the complement, which is easier to count:\n\nCase 1: there is a cycle of length $3$. There are $2 \\tbinom{6}{3} = 40$ possible cycles, and then $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the remaining three elements, for $40 \\cdot 6 = 240$ permutations total. But this double-counts permutations with two $3$-cycles: there are $2^2 \\cdot \\tfrac12\\tbinom{6}{3} = 40$ such permutations, so we have $240 - 40 = 200$ permutations with at least one $3$-cycle.\nCase 2: there is a cycle of length $5$. There are $6$ ways to choose the loner, which maps to itself, and then $4! = 24$ ways to choose the order of the $5$-cycle. Thus we have $6 \\cdot 24 = 144$ permutations with a $5$-cycle.\nCase 3: there is a cycle of length $6$. There are $5! = 120$ such permutations.\n\nThus we have $200 + 144 + 120 = 464$ permutations which violate the condition, and thus $6! - 464 = 720 - 464 = 256$ permutations that work, for a probability of $\\tfrac{256}{720} = \\tfrac{16}{45}$.\n\nThis post has been edited 2 times.

Suppose the length of the segment $\\mathcal P$ cuts the $x$-axis is $1$.  What is the length of the segment $\\mathcal P$ cuts the $y$-axis?\n\nActually, I like my $x$ and $y$ axes where they are, but I also would like to keep the parabola $y=x^2$. So I fix the $x,y-$axes+parabola and denote the results after the rotation as the orthogonal lines $u$ and $v$ who coincide at the origin. Write the second coincidence of $u$ and the parabola $y=x^2$ as the point $(\\delta,\\delta^2)$ for some $x$-coordinate $\\delta$. By pythag we have $\\delta^2(\\delta^2+1)=\\delta^2+\\delta^4=1\\implies \\delta=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}$. We also have that $u(x)=\\delta x$ and $v(x)=-\\tfrac{1}{\\delta}x$. The second intersection of the parabola and $v$ has $x^2=v(x)=-\\tfrac{1}{\\delta}x$, so it occurs at $(-\\tfrac{1}{\\delta},\\tfrac{1}{\\delta^2})$. Thus our desired length is $$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\delta^2}+\\frac{1}{\\delta^4}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta^2+1}{\\delta^4}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\delta^6}}=\\frac{1}{\\delta^3}=\\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{(-1+\\sqrt{5})^3}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{-2+\\sqrt{5}}}=\\boxed{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{5}}}$$\n\nThe solution has the interesting property that it can not be represented as $a+b\\sqrt{c},\\ a,b,c\\in\\mathbb Q$, since its minimal polynomial, of fourth degree, is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n\nThis post has been edited 2 times.

First rewrite the integrand as\n\n\\[1+2\\cdot 2^{-3/x}-3\\cdot 2^{-2/x}.\\]Seems promising, but the $2$'s and $3$'s are mismatched... how can we fix that? I guess doing $a\\mapsto 6/a$ in the exponents would swap the $2$ and $3$, so we can try that. Rewrite again as\n\n\\[1+2\\cdot 2^{-6/(2x)}-3\\cdot 2^{-6/3x}=1+2\\cdot {64}^{-1/2x}-3\\cdot {64}^{-1/3x}.\\]Now they're matched up! Looking a bit closer, these expressions look very similar, just with a $2$ instead of a $3$. Maybe there's some $f(x)$ here... Oh! Noting that $1=3-2$, we can further write this as\n\n\\[(3-3\\cdot 64^{-1/3x})-(2-2\\cdot 64^{-1/2x}).\\]This is really starting to look like a Frullani integral... but there's no $x$ in the denominator!

You are given an $n\\times n$ grid of squares (for integer $n\\geq 2$), each of which is either blank or has an arrow pointing up, down, left, or right. You are also given a $2\\times 2$ grid of squares that appears somewhere in this grid, possibly rotated.

It's in the bottom left, rotated by $90^\\circ$ clockwise. To make the game as interesting as possible, Mellon Game Lab would like the grid to be as large as possible and for no $2\\times 2$ grid to appear more than once in the big grid. The grid above doesn't work, as the following $2\\times 2$ grid appears twice, once in the top left corner (rotated $90^\\circ$ counterclockwise) and once directly below it (overlapping).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's call a grid that avoids such repeats a repeat-free grid. We are interested in finding out for which $n$ constructing an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid is possible. Here's what we know so far.\n\nAny $2\\times 2$ grid is repeat-free, as there is only one subgrid to worry about, and there can't possibly be any repeats.\nIf we can construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid, we can also construct a $k\\times k$ repeat-free grid for any $k\\leq n$ by just taking the top left $k\\times k$ of the original one we found.\nBy the previous observation, if it is impossible to construct such an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid, we cannot construct a $k\\times k$ repeat-free grid for any $k\\geq n$, as otherwise we could take the top left $n\\times n$ to get one working for $n$.\n\n\n\nThese three observations together tell us that either we can construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid for all $n\\geq 2$, or there exists some upper limit $N\\geq 2$ such that we can construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid for all $n\\leq N$ but cannot construct one for any $n> N$. Your goal is to determine if such an $N$ exists, and if so, place bounds on its value.\n\n\n\nMore precisely, this problem consists of two parts: a lower bound and an upper bound. For the lower bound, to show that $N\\geq n$ for some $n$, you need to construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid (you do not need to prove your construction works).

Note that there are $4$ possible rotation of a $2 \\times 2$ square that map it to a $2 \\times 2$ square with the same orientation of its sides.

        "solution": "Y by AtharvNaphade, LLL2019Context: I got 59 points in contest, doing this problem all by myself, the highest of any team (yes flex) (my greatest accomplishment) (we won TCS overall)\n\n\n\nMost proofs are highly unrigorous given the time limit.\n\n\n\nOutline of my solution, in contest, including a little bit of my thought process:\n\n\n\nSince I knew everyone else would go for the first two problems, I decided to go to this one. For the first 50 minutes, I completely regretted this decision.\n\n\n\nAt first sight, the problem looks super intimidating. I began by reading the problem. Then reading it again. Then getting distracted and reading it again. After a while (around 20 minutes, probably because I kept getting distracted), I was able to understand the notation. In fact, under the $G(n,k,r,(p_1,\\dots p_n))$, I wrote \"num doors, num turns, num rounds, probabilities\" to help me remember the notation better.\n\n\n\nThroughout the problems, assume that any provided constructions for probabilities can be permuted, by symmetry.\n\n\n\nI began with the first subproblem (3 points): Show that $G(3,1,1,(p_1,p_2,p_3))$ can be less than $1$. For this, I tested a few probabilities and came to the following lemma:\n\n\n\nWhen opening two doors with probabilities $p$ and $q$, the unopened door will get weighted by a factor of $2$. In other words, the remaining probabilities will be $0, 2p$ or $0, 2q$, scaled so that the sum of all the probabilities is still $1$. This is easy to prove by conditional probability concepts.\n\n\n\nThis is sufficient to solve this problem, and (iirc) the example I came up with was $\\left(\\frac12, \\frac13, \\frac16\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThe next subproblem (3 points) was to show that $G(n,n-2,1,(p_1,\\dots p_n))$ can be less than $1$ for all $n \\geq 3$.\n\n\n\nFor this, I made the following claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: It is always optimal to open the doors with the smallest probabilities. The reason for this is because, if we want to maximize $F$, then we need all the probabilities to be as close to each other as possible. In my proof, I didn't really account for the case where we might want to make them farther apart temporarily then make them closer later. However, I assumed that this would just be a simple yet annoying edge case check, so I didn't mention it.\n\n\n\nAt this point, I realized that the problem would be simplest if, after combining two doors, the sum of the probabilities remained the same. This would imply that the doors combined must have the same probability. This gave me the idea for the following solution:\n\n\n\nWe can simply take the probabilities $\\left(\\frac 12, \\frac 13, \\frac 16, \\frac 1{12}, \\dots \\frac{1}{6\\cdot 2^{n-2}}, \\frac{1}{6\\cdot 2^{n-2}}\\right)$, and combining the smallest two probabilities will collapse into a case with $n \\mapsto n-1$, since the sum of all the probabilities remains the same.\n\n\n\nThe next subproblem (3 points) was to show that $G(3,1,1,(p_1,p_2,p_3))$ can be $1$. This is easy to do with $\\left(\\frac12,\\frac14,\\frac14\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThe next subproblem (10 points) is to show that there exists a tuple $(n,k,1,(p_1,\\dots p_n))$ with $n>2024, k>506$ such that for all increasing $k'$ from $1$ to $k$ increases $G(n,k',1,(p_1,\\dots p_n))$ and the value is $1$ when $k'=k$.\n\n\n\nFor this, I simply noted that when the probabilities are $\\left(\\frac12, \\frac14, \\dots \\frac1{2^{n-1}}, \\frac1{2^{n-1}}\\right)$ and there are no more turns, then the final score is $\\frac{n}{2^{n-1}}$. Since each turn decreases $n$, we can simply take this set of probabilities for sufficiently large $n > k > 2025$. This is because the probability increases as $n$ increases until we reach $n=2$.\n\n\n\nAt this point, I tried to get some of my team members to help me, to no avail. Three of them were working on the problem one construction, two on the bound, and two more were working on problem 2.\n\n\n\nThe next subproblem (6 points): Determine when $G(4,k,r,(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)) = r$.\n\n\n\nI immediately thought to do casework on $r$: we are given that $rk+1 < n$. Therefore, we check when $r=2$, so $k=1$. Then, we require that after $1$ turn, the probabilities are all equal, and after another turn, the probabilities are once again all equal. However, in one turn, the probabilities $\\left(\\frac13, \\frac13, \\frac13\\right)$ can only be turned into $\\left(\\frac13, \\frac23\\right)$.\n\n\n\nTherefore, we must instead have $r=1$. The set of probabilities which can be reduced to $\\left(\\frac13, \\frac13, \\frac13\\right)$ in exactly one move consists only of $\\left(\\frac13, \\frac13, \\frac16, \\frac16\\right)$. Note that in this case, $k$ can be either $1$ or $2$ To reduce to $\\left(\\frac12, \\frac12\\right)$ in exactly two moves, we must have $\\left(\\frac12, \\frac14, \\frac18, \\frac18\\right)$ and $k=2$.\n\n\n\nNow, we continue to the problem of showing when $G(n,k,r,(p_1,\\dots p_n)) = r$. The points are as follows:\n\n\n\n5 points for $k=1$\n\n10 points for $k=2, r=1$\n\n20 points for $r=1$ with exactly $k$ turns per round\n\n35 points for $r=1$\n\n55 points for $r=1,2$\n\n75 points for a full solution\n\n\n\nWhen I saw these scoring guidelines, I only had around 15 minutes left. I first tried $k=1$, thinking that the lack of a restriction on $r$ is strange. Of course, it turns out this case is trivial: I quickly realized $r$ must be $1$ simply because you cannot go from one position of all equal probabilities to another position of all equal probabilities in one turn.\n\n\n\nI then decided to try $r=1$. My conjecture for this, based on previous problems, is simply to modify the power of $2$ strategy from the $n=4$ case. However, I did not really provide a specific proof for this. Specifically, we could have some amount of equal probabilities, then use the dividing by $2$ strategy constantly.\n\n\n\nI here quickly realized that the 20 point case is isomorphic to the 35 point case, because we can simply just take all the values of $k$ bigger than the exact number of turns necessary.\n\n\n\nAnyways, it took me 10 very unfortunate minutes to actually calculate the annoying values and indices. Eventually, the probabilities which can be collapsed into an all equal case in exactly $k$ turns is\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\left(\n\\frac{1}{n-k+1}, \\frac{1}{n-k+1}, \\dots \\frac{1}{n-k+1}, \\frac{1}{(n-k+1)2}, \\frac{1}{(n-k+1)2^2}, \\dots \\frac{1}{(n-k+1)2^{k}}, \\frac{1}{(n-k+1)2^{k}}\n\\right)\n\\]where $\\frac{1}{n-k+1}$ occurs $n-k$ times. Then, for the 35 point case, we can simply take anything larger than this $k$ as the new $k$ value to produce a valid tuple.\n\n\n\nOnce I did this, I had around 5 minutes left, but instead of trying to prove my unproven lemmas, I wondered how it would be possible to go from one set of equal probabilities to another, smaller set, thereby giving an $r=2$ solution. I came to the conclusion that the only way this is possible is if the $n-k+1$ in the previous problem is even, and we can combine pairs to form another equal configuration. I was definitely unable to support this conclusion with any proof, but nonetheless I wrote up my thoughts. Clearly, if this is true, the general solution is much the same as $r=2$.\n\n\n\nWe start with a configuration such as the tuple mentioned above, and it suffices that $2^r$ divides $n-k+1$. However, in the contest, I only had time to writeup my ideas for extending to $r=2$. I said that $n-k+1$ would have to be even, and we could combine in pairs, and with no time remaining added that \"It is easy to extend this idea to larger $r$\".\n\n\n\nIf I ever decide to prove many of these claims rigorously, I will definitely return...",

If $q\\sim [a_0;a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_n]$ is the simple continued fraction representation of a rational number $q$, then\n\n\\[\nf(q) = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n.\n\\]Proof. Induction.  The base case holds by inspection, and for the inductive step, remark that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf([a_0;a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_n]) &= a_0 + f([0;a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_n]) \\\\\n&= a_0 + f([a_1;a_2,\\ldots, a_n]) \\\\\n&\\stackrel{\\textrm{IH}}=a_0 + a_1 + \\cdots + a_n. \\quad\\square\n\\end{align*}\n\nLemma 2 (Behavior on negative inputs).

That is, the minus sign serves to subtract $1$ from the overall sum when $f$ is applied.  Another round of induction finishes.  $\\square$\n\n\n\nWe now proceed with the original problem.  Define $Q_n := P_{4n}$ for each positive integer $n$; compute $Q_0 = 0$ and $Q_1 = 12$.  The characteristic polynomial of the recurrence $(P_n)$ is $\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda - 1$, which has roots $r$ and $s$ satisfying $r+s=2$ and $rs = -1$.  Thus $Q_n$ has characteristic polynomial with roots $r^4$ and $s^4$, which can be computed by any method of choice to be $\\lambda^2 - 34\\lambda + 1$.\n\nThis means\n\n\\[\nQ_n = 34 Q_{n-1} - Q_{n-2}\\text{ for every }n\\geq 2,\n\\]or\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Q_{n}}{Q_{n-1}} = 34 - \\frac{Q_{n-2}}{Q_{n-1}}.\n\\]It follows from induction and $\\tfrac{Q_2}{Q_1} = 34$ that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Q_6}{Q_5} = [34;-34,-34,-34,-34],\n\\]so $f(\\tfrac{Q_5}{Q_6}) = f(\\tfrac{Q_6}{Q_5}) = 5\\cdot 34 - 4 = \\boxed{166}$.\n\nThis post has been edited 4 times.

Compute the total number of ways for the students to arrange themselves in a line such that:\n\nfor all $1 < i < 12$, the person in the $i$-th position (with the leftmost position being $1$) is taller than exactly $i\\pmod 3$ of their adjacent neighbors, and\nthe students standing at positions which are multiples of $3$ are strictly increasing in height from left to right.\n\n\n\nProposed by Nancy Kuang",
        "solution": "First, note that from the first condition, the heights of the people in line have to follow this pattern: $$\\underline{\\phantom{n}} < \\underline{\\phantom{n}} > \\underline{\\phantom{n}} < \\underline{\\phantom{n}} < \\underline{\\phantom{n}} > \\underline{\\phantom{n}} < \\underline{\\phantom{n}} < \\underline{\\phantom{n}} > \\underline{\\phantom{n}} < \\underline{\\phantom{n}} < \\underline{\\phantom{n}} > \\underline{\\phantom{n}}$$Now we will provide a method that constructs a line that satisfies the requirements.\n\nFirst, pick two students who are not yet in line.  Do not pick the two shortest students not yet in line.\nPut the shorter of the two students in the next spot in line, then put in the taller student.\nTake the shortest student still not in line and place them next.\nRepeat this process until all students have been placed in line.\n\nFor example, we could pick students $1$ and $3$ to be the line, and then student $2$ will join the line next.  (For our purposes, student $i$ is taller than student $j$ if and only if $i > j$.)  Then, we could pick students $10$ and $12$, and then student $4$ would join.  Then, we could pick $6$ and $9$, and then $5$.  Last, we pick $8$ and $11$, making $7$ join last.  After each iteration, the line looks like this:\n\n$$1,3,2 \\qquad [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]$$$$1,3,2,10,12,4 \\qquad [5,6,7,8,9,11]$$$$1,3,2,10,12,4,6,9,5 \\qquad [7,8,11]$$$$1,3,2,10,12,4,6,9,5,8,11,7 \\quad\\, [\\ ]$$\n\nWe show that this construction counts each valid line exactly once, and counts each invalid line zero times.  First of all, making a different choice at one iteration results in different lines, so no line is counted more than once.  This line is also incapable of making invalid lines: both conditions must be satisfied based on the nature of the construction.  Finally, any given valid line can be constructed, the reason for which we will motivate by an example:\n\n\n\nSuppose the given valid line starts off as $1,2,3$.  This is not allowed because the third person has to be shorter than the second person.  This fact allows us to complete the first step.  Now suppose the given line starts with students $6$ and $9$ (this is allowed).  In a valid line, they must be in the order $6,9$, in order to follow the pattern, so we can complete the second step.  Next, student $1$ (the shortest student not yet in line) cannot go anywhere other than right after $9$: putting them later would violate the pattern and/or condition two.  Therefore the given line must include $1$ as coming next, so we can complete the third step.  Finally, all of the remaining students are taller than the third student in line, so the rest of the given line is not affected by the first three students.  This allows us to loop back on our method until all students have been placed.\n\n\n\nThe total number of valid lines is then equal to the total number of constructions.  There are $\\binom{n}{2} - 1$ choices at each iteration, if there are $n$ people left to place in the line.  Thus the total number of lines is $$\\left(\\binom{12}{2} - 1 \\right) \\left(\\binom{9}{2} - 1 \\right) \\left(\\binom{6}{2} - 1 \\right) \\left(\\binom{3}{2} - 1 \\right) = 65 \\times 35 \\times 14 \\times 2 = \\boxed{63700}.$$",

        "solution": "The key is to build a generating function with two formal variables: $x$. whose exponent represents the number of cards strictly between the two jokers, and $y$. whose exponent represents the sum of the ranks of the cards strictly between the jokers.\n\n\n\nTo begin, note that if there are $a_1$ $1$'s, $a_2$ $2$'s, ..., $a_{13}$ $13$'s between the two jokers and $S := a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{13}$, then there are\n\n$\\frac{S!}{a_1! a_2! \\dots a_{13}!}$ ways to arrange the cards between the jokers, and $\\frac{(53-S)!}{(4-a_1)! (4-a_2)! \\dots (4-a_{13})!}$ ways to arrange the rest of the cards, since we may consider all cards between the jokers inclusive as one big card (to make $53-S$ total cards with $4-a_1$ $1$'s, $4-a_2$ $2$'s, and so on). Furthermore, there are a total of $\\frac{54!}{4!^{13} \\cdot 2}$ ways to arrange the cards. Hence if\n\n\\[ f(x, y) = \\frac{4!^{13} \\cdot 2}{54!} \\sum_{0 \\le a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{13} \\le 4} \\frac{S!}{a_1! a_2! \\dots a_{13}!} \\cdot \\frac{(53-S)!}{(4-a_1)! (4-a_2)! \\dots (4-a_{13})!} x^S y^{a_1 + 2a_2 + \\dots +13a_{13}},\\]then the answer is the sum of the coefficients of the terms with exponent of $y$ divisible by $13$ (the exponent of $x$ doesn't matter). We can rewrite this as\n\n\\begin{align*} \n  f(x, y) &= \\frac{4!^{13} \\cdot 2}{54!} \\sum_{0 \\le a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{13} \\le 4} \\frac{53!}{\\binom{53}S} \\cdot \\frac1{4!^{13}} \\binom{4}{a_1} \\binom{4}{a_2} \\dots \\binom{4}{a_{13}}  x^S y^{a_1 + 2a_2 + \\dots +13a_{13}}, \\\\\n&= \\frac1{27} \\sum_{0 \\le a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{13} \\le 4} \\frac{x^S}{\\binom{53}S} \\binom{4}{a_1} \\left(y^1 \\right)^{a_1} \\cdot \\binom{4}{a_2} \\left(y^2 \\right)^{a_2} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\binom{4}{a_{13}} \\left(y^{13} \\right)^{a_{13}}.\n\\end{align*}Thus if\n\n\\[g(x, y) := \\frac1{27} \\left( \\sum_{a_1=0}^4 x \\binom{4}{a_1} y^1 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{a_2=0}^4 x \\binom{4}{a_2} y^2 \\right) \\dots \\left( \\sum_{a_{13}=0}^4 x \\binom{4}{a_{13}} y^{13} \\right) =  \\frac1{27}(1+xy)^4 (1+xy^2)^4 \\dots (1+xy^{13})^4\\]then $g$ has the same terms as $f$ except with each power of $x$ of the form $x^S$ having a coefficient $\\binom{53}{S}$ times larger. Now, treating $g$ like a polynomial in $y$ alone, we can compute the sum of the coefficients of the terms with an exponent of $y$ divisible by $13$ to obtain a polynomial in $x$, then change each term of the form $x^S$ to $\\frac1{\\binom{53}{S}}$ to obtain our answer. This is pretty easy with the root of unity filter: let $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 13}$. Then the desired polynomial in $x$ is\n\n\\[ h(x) := \\frac{g(x, 1) + g(x, \\omega) + \\dots + g(x, \\omega^{12})}{13} \\]For any primitive $13$th root of unity $\\zeta$, $1, \\zeta^2, \\dots, \\zeta^{12}$ covers all possible roots of unity, so\n\n\\begin{align*} \n  g(x, \\zeta) &= \\frac1{27} ((1+x\\zeta) (1+x\\zeta^2) \\dots (1+x\\zeta^{13}))^4 \\\\\n  &= \\frac1{27} \\left( -x^{13} \\left(-\\frac1x - \\zeta\\right) \\left(-\\frac1x - \\zeta^2\\right) \\dots \\left(-\\frac1x - \\zeta^{13}\\right) \\right)^4 \\\\\n  &= \\frac1{27} \\left( -x^{13} \\left(\\left(-\\frac1x\\right)^{13} - 1\\right) \\right)^4 \\\\\n  &= \\frac1{27} (x^{13} + 1)^4.\n\\end{align*}But $13$ is prime, so all such $\\omega^k$ with $0<k<13$ are primitive, hence\n\n\\[ h(x) = \\frac{g(x, 1) + 12 g(x, \\omega)}{13} = \\frac1{13} \\left(\\frac{(1+x)^{52}}{27} + 12 \\cdot \\frac{(x^{13} + 1)^4}{27} \\right).\\]Now it suffices to change each $x^S$ to $\\frac1{\\binom{53}{S}}$ and sum the resulting expression.\n\n\n\nFor the first term, each monomial is of the form $\\frac1{13 \\cdot 27} \\binom{52}{S} x^S$, hence each monomial contributes\n\n\\[ \\frac1{13 \\cdot 27} \\cdot \\frac{\\binom{52}{S}}{\\binom{53}{S}} = \\frac1{13 \\cdot 27} \\cdot \\frac{52! \\cdot S! \\cdot (53 - S)!}{53! \\cdot S! \\cdot (52 - S)!} = \\frac{53 - S}{13 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 53}.\\]Summing from $S = 0$ to $52$, this contributes a total of $\\frac1{13 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 53} \\cdot \\frac{53 \\cdot 54}{2} = \\frac1{13}$.\n\n\n\nNow for the second term, we can expand normally to find that the expression is\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{13 \\cdot 27} \\left( 1 + 4x^{13} + 6x^{26} + 4x^{39} + x^{52} \\right).\\]Ignoring the constant at the front, the first and the last monomial give $1$ and $\\frac1{53}$, respectively, while the middle three contribute less than $\\frac{9}{\\binom{53}{12}} \\ll 10^{-9}$ (not enough), hence the answer is\n\n\\[ \\frac1{13} + \\frac{12}{13 \\cdot 27} \\left(1 + \\frac1{53} \\right) = \\frac1{13} + \\frac{12}{13 \\cdot 27} \\cdot \\frac{54}{53} = \\frac{53 + 24}{689} = \\frac{77}{689}. \\]",

The letter corresponds to the suit of the card. Suppose we place each card in a row, where cards to the left are placed earlier (ie, the leftmost card is the first card placed down). This is obviously equivalent to the original problem.\n\n\n\nNow, here's the cool part: Assume we have the following \"placement\" of cards (this is just an example):$$B1, A1, A2, A3, A4, \\ldots$$The score of card $A2$ is obviously $1$, the score of card $A3$ is $2$, and the score of card $A4$ is $3$ (this comes from the given scoring system). However, we can also interpret the score of an individual card as the number of \"runs\" of same-suit cards (of any length) that a particular card \"ends\". For example, the card $A4$ \"ends\" exactly $3$ runs - the run $A3, A4$, the run $A2, A3, A4$, and the run $A1, A2, A3, A4$. This is obviously true for any arbitrary card.\n\n\n\nUsing this new definition, we see that the final score is simply the number of runs (of any length) in the entire row. This is now quite easy to count via casework and linearity of expectation.\n\n\n\nWe wish to find the expected number of runs of length $n$ in the entire row ($n$ will obviously range from $2$ to $13$ in our final answer). There are $53-n$ possible \"locations\" where the run could be. At each one of these locations, there is a $\\frac {12}{51}\\cdot \\frac{11}{50}\\cdots \\frac{14-n}{53-n}$ probability of a run of length $n$ occuring. Thus, the expected number of runs of length $n$ in the entire row is just$$\\left(\\frac {12}{51}\\cdot \\frac{11}{50}\\cdots \\frac{14-n}{53-n}\\right)\\cdot (53-n)$$by linearity.

Then there are 23 mines left in $81-15=66$ spots, so there are $\\tbinom{66}{23}$ ways to finish.\nProbability $p_2$ that center is not mine and conditions hold. First case is that the X is to the direct left or direct right of the center:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| }\n\\hline\n~&~&~ \\\\ \\hline\n~&4&~ \\\\ \\hline\n$X$ & $\\cdot$ & $\\cdot$ \\\\ \\hline\n$\\cdot$& 1 & $\\cdot$\\\\ \\hline\n$\\cdot$ & $\\cdot$ & $\\cdot$ \\\\ \n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\]There are 2 ways to choose left or right for X, and then $\\tbinom53$ ways to place other 3 mines.

        "solution": "This is a really nice problem, kind of like HMMT 2018 C4 buffed; indeed, much of the solution to that problem motivated the following. Really hard bijection problem.\n\n\n\nMark a dot at points $(i,a_i)$ for each $1\\le i \\le 16$. If $a_{16}<16$, draw a vertical line from $(16,a_{16})$ to $(16,16)$. So we have an up-and-right lattice path from $(0,0)$ to $(16,16)$. The height of column $i$ under this path is $a_i$, so the sum of $a_i$ is the area under the path.\n\nConsider the first (odd, odd) point in the path. (Or any (fixed parity, fixed parity) point.) The key is that we must have either (1) _| or (2) |$\\overline{\\cdot}$ to get to this point in the path before, since if we have -- or two verticals, then it is not the minimal (odd, odd) point. The key is that the area under the path if we flip between (1) and (2) changes exactly by 1, so in particular one has even area and one has odd area. Therefore, in the set of paths which have at least one (odd, odd) point, this bijection proves exactly half have odd area!\nBut what if there is no (odd, odd) point? We claim every column has even height then. If $i$ is odd, then $a_i$ must be even, so even height. If $i$ is even, even columns cannot have odd height, since then we must go horizontal by 1 to the next column, which means the next column has an (odd, odd) point! In conclusion, every path in the set of paths with no (odd, odd) point has even area.\n\nSo if there are $A$ paths with no (odd, odd) point, the answer is\n\n\\[ \\frac12\\left( \\binom{32}{16} - A \\right) + A.\\]It is easy to compute that $A = \\tbinom{16}{8}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\tfrac12 \\left( \\tbinom{32}{16} + \\tbinom{16}{8}\\right)}$.",

This happens with probability $8/13$. WLOG it belongs to Ru. Now, we have 5 Shen slips, 4 Ling slips, and 3 Ru slips. We need the second Shen slip to be drawn after the first Ling slip. Observe that the Ru slips do not matter anymore, so they can be ignored. The only way for Shen to lose is if his second slip comes before the first Ling slip, which happens with probability $5/9\\times4/8=5/18$. Thus, Shen has a $13/18$ chance to win.

        "solution": "Y by codyj, Adventure10, Mango247SolutionThe equation becomes $a^2+b^2=n(a+b)$, so $a+b\\mid a^2+b^2$; equivalently, $a+b\\mid2ab$. We will find all pairs of positive integers $(a,b)$ satisfying $a+b\\mid2ab$. Let $\\frac{2ab}{a+b}=c$; then $4ab-2ac-2bc=0$, so $(2a-c)(2b-c)=c^2$. Let $2a-c=kp^2$ and $2b-c=kq^2$. Then, $c=kpq$, so $a=\\frac{kp^2+kpq}{2}=kp\\cdot\\frac{p+q}{2}$ and $b=kq\\cdot\\frac{p+q}{2}$.\n\n\n\nFrom above, we have $a=kp\\cdot\\frac{p+q}{2}$ and $b=kq\\cdot\\frac{p+q}{2}$. Since $a\\neq b$, we have $p\\neq q$. Now,\n\n\\[n=\\frac{a^2+b^2}{a+b}=\\frac{k^2\\left(\\frac{p+q}{2}\\right)^2(p^2+q^2)}{k\\frac{(p+q)^2}{2}}=\\frac{k(p^2+q^2)}{2}.\\]We need $k(p^2+q^2)$ to be even for $n$ to be an integer. However, note that since $a+b$ is an integer, $k(p+q)^2$ is even, which implies that $k(p^2+q^2)$ is too. Thus, it is enough for $2a=kp(p+q)$ and $2b=kq(p+q)$ to be even.\n\n\n\nThe only other restriction we have is that $p\\neq q$. To satisfy $kp(p+q)$ and $kq(p+q)$ being even, we take $k$ to be an even integer $2l$. This makes $a$ and $b$ both integers, and makes $n=l(p^2+q^2)$. If $n$ has a prime divisor congruent to $1\\pmod{4}$, then we can set $p^2+q^2$ to this divisor, and we are good.\n\n\n\nConversely, if $n$'s only prime divisors are congruent to $2$ or $3\\pmod{4}$, we show that $n$ cannot be $\\frac{k(p^2+q^2)}{2}$. If $k$ is even, then letting $k=2l$, we have $n=l(p^2+q^2)$, which we have problems with, since $p\\neq q$ implies that $p^2+q^2$ has a prime divisor congruent to $1\\pmod{4}$. If $k$ is odd, then $p^2+q^2$ is even, so $p\\equiv q\\pmod{2}$. Then, $n=k\\left(\\left(\\frac{p+q}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{p-q}{2}\\right)^2\\right)$, so we run into the same problem as when $k$ is even.\n\n\n\nSo we see that $n$ satisfies the condition if and only if $n$ has a prime divisor congruent to $1\\pmod{4}$. Now, we simply bash:\n\n\n\n5: 5, 10, ..., 50 [10]\n\n13: 13, 26, 39 [13]\n\n17: 17, 34 [15]\n\n29: 29 [16]\n\n37: 37 [17]\n\n41: 41 [18]\n\n\n\nThe answer is thus $\\boxed{18}$.\n\n\n\nNot sure of this solution; can someone check?",

In the interest of the Contest Collections page, I'll post the official solution.\n\n\n\nSolutionBefore trudging onward, it helps to deduce a few properties of any system of congruences which is valid.\n\n\n\nFirst, remark that the values of $\\pi(1)$, $\\pi(5)$, and $\\pi(7)$ are independent of values of other congruences.  In other words, when building a valid permutation it suffices to compute the other six values and then randomly assign these three at the end.\n\n\n\nNow remark that $\\pi(km)\\equiv\\pi(k)\\pmod k$ for all $k$ and $m$ for which the previous congruence is valid.  This is because the modulus of $N$ modulo $km$ determines the modulus of $N$ mod $k$, and so the results must be consistent.  The following consequences are direct colloraries of this fact:\n\n\n\n\nAll even indexes, i.e. all $\\pi(2k)$ for $k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, must have the same parity.  For example, $\\pi(2)\\equiv\\pi(8)\\pmod 2$.  (The same is not necessarily true of the odds, however; in particular, when $\\pi(2)$ is odd, one of $\\pi(1)$, $\\pi(3)$, $\\ldots$, $\\pi(9)$ must also be odd.  This is a result of the fact that $9$ is itself odd.)\n\n\nAs an extension, $\\pi(8)-\\pi(4)$ must be an integral multiple of $4$.  Since $9-1=8$, we need either $|\\pi(8)-\\pi(4)|=4$ or $|\\pi(8)-\\pi(4)|=8.$\n\n\nNote that $\\pi(3)\\equiv\\pi(6)\\equiv\\pi(9)\\pmod 3$.  This in particular means that \\[\\{\\pi(3),\\pi(6),\\pi(9)\\}\\in\\{\\{1,4,7\\},\\{2,5,8\\},\\{3,6,9\\}\\}.\\]\nSubject to all these conditions, a solution exists by the Chinese Remainder Theorem on the moduli $5$, $7$, $8$, and $9$.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have enough information to start counting.  We split the calculation into two cases.\n\n\n\n\n$\\textbf{CASE 1: }\\pi(2k)\\equiv 0\\pmod 2$ $\\forall k$. In this case, remark that $\\{\\pi(4),\\pi(8)\\}$ can only be one of $\\{2,6\\}$ or $\\{4,8\\}$.  Noting the third bullet point above, we see that in the former case we must have $\\pi(6)=4$; in the latter case we must have $\\pi(6)=6$ (why?).  From these, $\\pi(2)$ is uniquely determined, and there are two ways to choose the ordered pair $(\\pi(3),\\pi(9))$.  Thus in total there are $2\\times 2\\times 2=8$ possibilities in this case.\n\n\n$\\textbf{CASE 2: }\\pi(2k)\\equiv 1\\pmod 2$ $\\forall k$. In this case, there are more choices for the set $\\{\\pi(4),\\pi(8)\\}$.  In fact, there are four: $\\{1,5\\}$, $\\{3,7\\}$, $\\{5,9\\}$, and $\\{1,9\\}$.  Because of this, we need to be more careful about how we enumerate the possible permutations which work.  We again split into two cases:\n\n\n$\\textbf{SUBCASE 1: }\\{\\pi(4),\\pi(8)\\} = \\{1,5\\}$ or $\\{5,9\\}$. Note that in these cases, there are two possible values of $\\pi(6)$; in the first one, $\\pi(6)\\in\\{3,9\\}$, while in the second, $\\pi(6)\\in\\{1,7\\}$.  Regardless of which member of which set is chosen, the other element in the set must also appear as some other element in $\\{\\pi(3),\\pi(9)\\}$.  For example,  if $\\pi(6)=1$, then either $\\pi(3)=7$ or $\\pi(9)=7$.  Combining this with the fact that all $\\pi(2k)$ have the same parity, we see that $\\pi(2)$ is actually fixed in these situations.  Thus, for each of the four possibilities for $(\\pi(4),\\pi(8))$, there are two possible values of $\\pi(6)$ and two possibilities for $(\\pi(3),\\pi(9))$, for $16$ different permutations which work.\n\n\n$\\textbf{SUBCASE 2: }\\{\\pi(4),\\pi(8)\\} = \\{3,7\\}$ or $\\{1,9\\}$. In contrast with the above, note that in these two cases, $\\pi(6)$ is fixed, which means there the value of $\\pi(2)$ can vary.  More specifically, for each of the four possibilities for $(\\pi(4),\\pi(8))$, there are two possible values for $\\pi(2)$ and two possibilities for $(\\pi(3),\\pi(9))$, for $16$ different permutations which work.\n\n\n\nThus, in this total case, $32$ systems are possible.\n\n\n\nFinally, there are three numbers left, and they can be assigned to $\\pi(1)$, $\\pi(5)$, and $\\pi(7)$ in $3!=6$ ways.  Thus, the total number of consistent systems is $6(8+32)=\\boxed{240}$.",

        "solution": "Y by Adventure10, Mango247In the interest of the Contests Page, I'll post the official solution to this problem.  This problem was proposed by me, but the solution below was discovered by AoPS user codyj.\n\n\n\nSolutionWe first make use of a lemma.\n\n\n\nLEMMA: Let $F(v)$ be a linear transformation in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and define \\[F(\\mathcal{P})=\\{F(v)\\,|\\, v\\in\\mathcal{P}\\}.\\]Then $F(\\mathcal{P})$ is also a parabola.\n\n\n\nProof. Omitted.  Use the fact that a conic of the form \\[ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey+f=0\\]is a parabola if and only if $b^2-4ac=0$.\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, scale the $y$-axis by $\\tfrac5{12}$.  This scaling preserves the trisection property of lines and furthermore preserves the tangency of $\\mathcal{P}$ to the $x$ and $y$ axes, and so the answer to the original question will be $\\tfrac{12}5$ the answer to this new problem.  Furthermore, rotate the entire diagram $45^\\circ$ counterclockwise about the origin.  By the arctangent formula, a line with slope $m$ in this frame has a slope of $\\tfrac{1-m}{1+m}$ in the original frame, so it's not hard to transform back and forth.\n\n\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P}'$ be the parabola which results from these transformations; then $\\mathcal{P'}$ is tangent to the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$ and the directrix of $\\mathcal{P'}$ is a line parallel to the line $y=0$.  This in turn means that $y=cx^2+d$ for some constants $c$ and $d$.  To deal with the fact that $\\mathcal{P'}$ is tangent to the lines $y=\\pm x$, note that this means the equations $y=cx^2-x+d$ and $y=cx^2+x+d$ each have exactly one root.  This means their discriminants are zero, so $1^2-4cd = 0\\implies d=\\tfrac{1}{4c}$.  In fact, we can make $c$ arbitrary due to scaling, so take $c=1$.  This gives $d=\\tfrac14$, so the equation of $\\mathcal{P}'$ is now $y=x^2+\\tfrac14$.\n\n\n\nConsider any $\\mathcal{P}'$-friendly segment with endpoints $(-3a,3a)$ and $(3b,3b)$.  We want $(-a+2b,a+2b)$ and $(-2a+b,2a+b)$ to both be points on $\\mathcal{P}'$.  This gives the system of equations \\[\\begin{cases}a+2b&=(-a+2b)^2+\\frac14,\\\\2a+b&=(-2a+b)^2+\\frac14.\\end{cases}\\]Subtracting the first equation from the second yields \\[a-b=(-2a+b)^2-(-a+2b)^2=(2a-b)^2-(a-2b)^2=3(a+b)(a-b).\\]Hence either $a=b$ or $a+b=\\tfrac13$.  In the former case, this segment is horizontal.  It's clear by the Intermediate Value Theorem (or an analogous argument) that there are precisely two such $\\mathcal{P}'$-friendly segments, contributing $2\\cdot\\tfrac{0-1}{0+1}=-2$ to the sum of the slopes of the lines.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if $a+b=\\tfrac13$, then let $m=\\tfrac{b-a}{b+a}=3(b-a)=6b-1$ be the slope of the line in question.  We wish to find the sum of the values of \\[\\dfrac{m-1}{m+1}=\\dfrac{6b-2}{6b}=1-\\frac1{3b},\\]i.e. the slopes of all lines after they have been rotated $45$ degrees.  Note that by plugging $a+b=\\tfrac13$ into the first equation of the system we get the quadratic \\[\\frac13+b=\\left(-\\frac13+3b\\right)^2+\\frac14.\\]Expanding and simplifying yields that this quadratic is equivalent to \\[9b^2-3b+\\frac1{36}=0,\\]so by Vieta's formulas if $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the two roots of the above quadratic then \\[\\left(1-\\frac1{3b_1}\\right)+\\left(1-\\frac1{3b_2}\\right) = 2-\\frac13\\left(\\dfrac{b_1+b_2}{b_1b_2}\\right)=2-\\frac13\\left(\\frac{3}{1/36}\\right) = 2-\\frac1{36}.\\]Therefore the sum of all the slopes of the lines for the original parabola $\\mathcal{P}$ is \\[\\dfrac{12}5\\left[-2+\\left(2-\\frac1{36}\\right)\\right]=-\\frac{432}5\\]and the requested answer is $432+5=\\boxed{437}$.\n\nThis post has been edited 1 time.

        "solution": "Y by Let $\\mathcal T$ denote the set of questions whose answers are true and $\\mathcal F$ denote the set of questions whose answers are false.If David makes $x$ questions correct in $\\mathcal T$ set ,then he writes $5-x$ False  in set $\\mathcal T$ which means he writes $4-(5-x)$ False in set $\\mathcal F$.This means he makes $x-1$ correct choises in set $\\mathcal F$.\n\n\n\nTogether he makes $x+(x-1)=2x-1$ coreect choices.We want $2x-1\\ge 5\\iff x\\ge 3$.\n\nNow the number of of making $x$ correct choice from $\\mathcal T$ and $x-1$ correct choice from $\\mathcal F$ is ${5\\choose x}{4\\choose x-1}$.\n\nTherefore,The required probability is:$$\\frac{{\\sum}_{x\\ge 3} {5\\choose x}{4\\choose x-1}}{{\\sum}_{x\\ge 1} {5\\choose x}{4\\choose x-1}}=\\frac{81}{126}=\\frac{9}{14}$$",
