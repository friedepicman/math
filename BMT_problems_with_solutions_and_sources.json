Why: Click to reveal hidden textBecause $\\ln x \\to -\\infty$ as $x\\to0^+$, $\\sin(\\ln x)$ has vertical asymptotes at $x=0$ and $x=\\pi$ (when $\\sin x=0$). Using some trig identities, we know that for $x\\in [0, \\pi]$, $\\sin x = \\sin(\\pi-x)$. Therefore, $\\ln(\\sin x) = \\ln(\\sin(\\pi-x))$, and $\\ln(\\sin(\\pi-x))$ is symmetric over the interval $[0, \\pi]$, with the axis of symmetry being $x=\\pi/2$..

        "text": "Let $N$ be the number of ways to draw 22 straight edges between 10 labeled points, of which no three are collinear, such that no triangle with vertices among these 10 points is created, and there is at most one edge between any two labeled points. Compute $\\dfrac{N}{9!}$.",
        "solution": "First, we note that this graph cannot have any $3$-cycles. We quickly deduce that the graph is bipartite as a result of the high number of straight edges - if there were more than two, and an odd number of categories, then the minimum number of categories is 5 where we get that neighboring categories have $4$ vertices in common and $4 \\cdot 5 = 20 < 22$. And that number decreases, so it never exceeds $22$.\n\n\n\nSo, the graph is bipartite. We note that we have two ways to split the graph: $6+4$ and $5+5$, since other splits have less than 22 edges. The $6+4$ case gives $\\binom{10}{4}$ ways to split the graph and then $\\binom{24}{2}$ ways to choose the two edges to remove, and the $5+5$ case gives $\\binom{10}{5} \\cdot \\frac12 = \\binom{9}{4}$ ways to split the graph and $\\binom{25}{3}$ ways to choose the two edges to remove. So, $$N=\\binom{10}{4} \\cdot \\binom{24}{2}+\\binom{9}{4} \\cdot \\binom{25}{3} = \\frac{10! \\cdot 24!}{6! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 22! \\cdot 2!} + \\frac{9! \\cdot 25!}{5! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 22! \\cdot 3!} = \\frac{10! \\cdot 24! + 9! \\cdot 25! \\cdot 2}{5! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 22! \\cdot 3!}$$$$= \\frac{(10+50) \\cdot 9! \\cdot 24!}{5! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 22! \\cdot 3!} = \\frac{60 \\cdot 9! \\cdot 24 \\cdot 23}{120 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{23}{24} \\cdot 9! \\to \\frac{N}{9!} = \\boxed{\\frac{23}{24}}. \\blacksquare$$\n\nRemark: Ever notice why BMT didn't make the answer nicer by asking for $\\frac{N}{7!}$ or $\\frac{N}{8!}$?",

If you draw a diagram and cut the tetrahedron in half, we get a 4-4-6 triangle. It suffices to find the height of this triangle. There are many ways to do this; one way is by using the area formula.

Therefore, the area of the whole triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\sqrt{7}=3\\sqrt{7}$. But what if we consider one of the legs as the base?

Then $\\angle BAM_A=\\angle CAM'_A=\\angle CYA.$ Therefore $\\triangle CXA \\sim \\triangle CAY$ so $CX\\cdot CY = CA^2.$ Note that $\\frac{DB}{DC}=\\frac{AB}{CY}$ and $\\frac{M_AB}{M_AC}=\\frac{AB}{CX}.$ Combining these we have $\\frac{DB}{DC}\\cdot \\frac{M_AB}{M_AC}=\\frac{AB^2}{AC^2}$ and since $M_A$ is the midpoint, $\\frac{DB}{DC}=\\frac{AB^2}{AC^2}.$ Let $AB=c, BC=a, CA=b.$ So $\\frac{DB}{DC}=\\frac{c^2}{b^2}$. Similarly, $\\frac{FB}{FA}=\\frac{a^2}{b^2}$ and $\\frac{EA}{EC}=\\frac{c^2}{a^2}$ From Van Aubel's theorem, $\\frac{AK}{KD}=\\frac{AE}{EC}+\\frac{AF}{FB}$. Substituting our results in, we have $\\frac{AK}{KD}=\\frac{c^2}{a^2}+\\frac{b^2}{a^2}=\\frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2},$ so $[KBC]:[ABC]=a^2:a^2+b^2+c^2.$ Therefore $[KAB]:[KBC]:[KCA]=c^2:a^2:b^2=17^2:14^2:12^2,$ so our final answer is $\\boxed{629}$",

Then by calculating the area using LoS, one way as a sum of the three triangle areas and another using the whole triangle, we have $$\\frac{1}{2}(8)(7)(\\sin{60})=14\\sqrt{3}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\sin{120})(xy+yz+xz)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(xy+yz+xz),$$so $xy+yz+xz=56.$\n\n\n\nIf we add the 3 equations up and factoring, we have $$2(x+y+z)^2-3(xy+yz+xz)=64+49+57=170 \\Rightarrow 2(x+y+z)^2=170+3(56) \\Rightarrow x+y+z=13.$$Also by adding them up, we have $$2(x^2+y^2+z^2)+(xy+yz+xz)=170 \\Rightarrow 2(x^2+y^2+z^2)=170-56 \\Rightarrow x^2+y^2+z^2=57.$$Subtracting $z^2+zx+x^2=57$ from $x^2+y^2+z^2=57,$ we get $y^2=zx,$ and so what we're looking for, $\\sqrt[3]{xyz}$ is just $\\sqrt[3]{(xz)(y)}=\\sqrt[3]{(y^2)(y)}=y.$\n\nFrom the third equation, we have $z^2+zx+x^2=(z+x)^2-xz=57,$ and as we know $x+y+z=13$ and $y^2=xz,$ this becomes $$(13-y)^2-y^2=169-26y+y^2-y^2=57 \\Rightarrow y=\\frac{56}{13}.$$Thus our answer is $\\fbox{69}.$\nAttachments:\nThis post has been edited 4 times.

However, since the polynomial has degree 2021, and there are only 2020 roots, we know that one of the roots must be a double root. Without considering double roots, P(2021) is 2020!. If (x-1) is a double root, we multiply by 2020. If (x-2) is a double root, we multiply by 2019, and so on. Since there are 2020 roots that can possibly be the double root, the mean of all possible values of p(2021) is 2020! * (2020+2019+2018+....+1) / 2020. This is simply 2021!/2, so a+b = 2023",

If $k=3$, it doesn't work. If $k=5$, it doesn't work. If $k=7$, it works. If $k=9$, it works. We notice from $7$ and up, it will always work because it is always going to be a multiple of $8$. We first notice that $k-1, k+1$ are both even, which gives at least $4$. Now there are $2$ cases. If $k-1$ is a multiple of $4$, it means we got a factor of $8$, if it isn't, we still do because $k, k+1$ must be.

For example, the player with the number $11$ has binary number $001011$. For the first and second pitch, they wait; for the third, they swing, and so on.

If a batter waits on a splitter, then they get a “ball.” If a batter gets $3$ strikes, then they are out; if a batter gets $4$ balls, then they automatically get a hit.

        "text": "Let triangle $ABC$ have side lengths $AB = 13$, $BC = 14$, $AC = 15$. Let $I$ be the incenter of $ABC$. The circle centered at $A$ of radius $AI$ intersects the circumcircle of $ABC$ at $H$ and $J$. Let $L$ be a point that lies on both the incircle of $ABC$ and line $HJ$. If the minimal possible value of $AL$ is $\\sqrt{n}$, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, find $n$.",
        "solution": "The first thing to observe here is that $HJ$ is in fact tangent to the incircle of $ABC$ at $L$. To prove this, we see that $A$ is the circumcenter of triangle $HIJ$, so by the incenter-excenter lemma, $I$ is the incenter of triangle $HJM$. In addition, observe that by Euler's theorem that $d^2 = R^2 - 2rR$, so the inradius of $HJM$ equal to the inradius of $ABC$.\n\n\n\nLet $HJ$ intersect $AB$ at $N$ and $AC$ at $O$. The main observation is that triangle $AON$ is similar to triangle $ABC$. To prove this, observe that by power of a point theorem, $AN \\times NB = HN \\times NJ = AI^2 - AN^2 \\implies AN(NB + AN) = AN \\times AB = AI^2$. Similarly, $AO \\times AC = AI^2$. Hence, $AN \\times AB = AO \\times AC \\implies \\frac{AN}{AC} = \\frac{AO}{AB}$. Thus, by SAS similarity, triangle $AON$ is similar to triangle $ABC$. Let the $A$-excenter of triangle $ABC$ be tangent to $BC$ at $U$ and the incircle of $ABC$ to be tangent at $BC$ at $R$. It is well known that $BR = UC = s - b = 6$. Since the height from $A$ of the triangle is $12$, we have by the pythagorean theorem that\n\n$$12^2 + (14 - 6 - 5)^2 = AU^2 \\implies AU = \\sqrt{153} = 3\\sqrt{17}$$In addition, it is well known that the ratio of the in-radius to the $A$-exradius is $\\frac{s - a}{s} = \\frac{7}{21} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Hence, $AL = \\frac{AU}{3} = \\sqrt{17}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{17}$.",

        "solution": "Y by Note $s=\\frac{3a}{2}$, so the area of the triangle is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac{3a}{2}\\left(\\frac{3a}{2}-(a-1)\\right)\\left(\\frac{3a}{2}-a\\right)\\left(\\frac{3a}{2}-(a+1)\\right)} \\rightarrow \\sqrt{\\frac{3a}{2}\\left(\\frac{a}{2}+1\\right)\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{a}{2}-1\\right)} \\rightarrow \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^2}{4}\\left(\\frac{a^2}{4}-1\\right)} \\rightarrow \\frac{a}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^2}{4}-3}$. Let $a=2u$. The expression is equal to $u\\sqrt{3u^2-3}$. The outside of the square root is always an integer, so we want $3u^2-3$ to be a perfect square. Since $a>14$, $u>7$. Note $3u^2-3=3(u-1)(u+1)$, so for this to be a perfect square, either $u-1$ or $u+1$ is a multiple of three (since both cannot). If $u$ is odd, then both of the unknown factors are even. If $u$ is even, the other two factors are odd, and we know one of these is a multiple of three. But we know $u>7$, so we test out possibilities and see if the result is a perfect square. A lot of results can be eliminated since $u-1$ or $u+1$ can become a prime that is greater than $3$, which would make that value impossible. So, the next best value for $u$ cannot be within one of a multiple of $5$, $7$, or any other prime greater than $3$ (unless that factor is a perfect square). $u=8$ fails by checking, $u=9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16$ fail because of an unnecessary prime factor, $17$ fails by checking, $u=18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25$ fail because of an unnecessary prime factor, but $u=26$ works since we get $3(25)(27)=5^2 \\cdot 3^4$, a perfect square. Since $u=26$, $a=\\boxed{52}$.\n\nThis post has been edited 1 time. Last edited by Bowser498, Jan 8, 2022, 8:57 PM",

Here, run means a series of uninterupted heads.\n\nThen we have the following recurrence \\[E_n = 1+\\frac{1}{2}*(E_{n+1}+E_0)\\]\n\nWhat this is saying is that if you have $n$ consecutive heads, then on your next flip you have an even chance of either getting heads and having $n+1$ consecuitve heads or getting tails and resetting back to zero.\n\nNow we know that $E_{60}=0$ so then we have\n\n\\[E_{60-t}=\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{t-1}{\\frac{1}{2}^i}+E_0\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{t}{\\frac{1}{2}^i}\\]\n\nPlugging in $t=60$ and solving for $E_0$ we get \\[E_0=2*(2^{60}-1)\\]\n\nNow $28=60-32$ thus\n\n\\[E_{28}=E_{60-32}=\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{31}{\\frac{1}{2}^i}+2*(2^{60}-1)\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{32}{\\frac{1}{2}^i}\\]\n\nSimplifying we get\n\n\\[E_{28}=2^{59}*(2^{32}-1)\\]\n\nSo we have $2$ as a prime divisor so to get the remaining prime divisors we need to find the prime divisors of\n\n$2^{32}-1$\n\n\\[2^{32}-1=(2^{16}+1)(2^{8}+1)(2^{4}-1)(2^{4}+1)=65537*257*15*17\\]\n\nso from $15$ and $17$ we get $3,5,17$ as prime divisors.  Now we just need to find the prime divisors of $65537$ and $257$.\n\n$17^2=289>257$ so any prime divisor of $257$ must be less than $17$, this leaves $2,3,5,7,11,13$ which can all be checked easily by hand to deterime that $257$ is prime.\n\nAs for $65537$ I had a hunch that it was prime but could not find a nice shortcut to prove it, so I wound up doing the rather tedious task of testing all primes less than $\\sqrt{65537}$ to determine that it is indeed prime.\n\n\n\nThus the solutions is $2+3+5+17+257+65537=65281$",
